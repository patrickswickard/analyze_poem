The Fountain of Blood

It seems to me sometimes my blood is bubbling out 
As fountains do, in rhythmic sobs; I feel it spout 
And lapse; I hear it plainly; it makes a murmuring sound; 
But from what wound it wells, so far I have not found.

As blood runs in the lists, round tumbled armored bones, 
It soaks the city, islanding the paving-stones; 
Everything thirsty leans to lap it, with stretched head; 
Trees suck it up; it stains their trunks and branches red.

I turn to wine for respite, I drink, and I drink deep; 
(Just for one day, one day, neither to see nor hear!) 
Wine only renders sharper the frantic eye and ear.

In terror I cry to love, "Oh, put my mind to sleep!" 
But love for me is only a mattress where I shrink 
On needles, and my blood is given to whores to drink.
