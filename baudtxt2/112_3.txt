Gipsies on the Road

The tribe of seers, last night, began its march 
With burning eyes, and shouldering its young 
To whose ferocious appetites it swung 
The wealth of hanging breasts that nought can parch.

The men, their weapons glinting in the rays, 
Walk by the convoy where their folks are carted, 
Sweeping the far-off skylines with a gaze 
Regretful of Chimeras long-departed.

Out of his hole the cricket sees them pass
And sings the louder. Greener grows the grass
Because Cybele loves them, and has made

The barren rock to gush, the sands to flower, 
To greet these travellers, before whose power 
Familiar futures open realms of shade.
