The Irreparable

How shall we kill this old, this long Remorse 
Which writhes continually 
And feeds on us as worms upon a corse, 
Maggots upon a tree? 
How stifle this implacable Remorse? 

What wine, what drug, what philtre known of man 
Will drown this ancient foe, 
Ruthless and ravenous as a courtesan. 
Sure as an ant, and slow? 
What wine? What drug? What philtre known of man? 

O tell, fair sorceress, tell if thou dost know 
This soul distraught with pain 
As a dying soldier crushed and bruised below 
Steel hooves and wounded men! 
O tell, fair sorceress, tell if thou dost know. 

This poor racked wretch the wolf already flays 
O'er whom the vultures whirr. 
This broken warrior! if in vain he prays 
For cross and sepulchre. 
This anguished wretch the wolf already flays! 

How should we rend dense gulfs which know not dawn 
Nor eve, nor any star? 
How pierce with light skies which abyss-like yawn 
When black as pitch they are? 
How should we rend dense gulfs which know not dawn? 

Hope glimmered in the windows of the Inn, 
But Hope is dead for aye! 
Moonless and rayless, can poor travellers win 
To shelter from the way? 
The Devil made dark the windows of the Inn! 

Dost love the damned, adorable sorceress? 
Dost know the smitten sore? 
Dost know Remorse that, grim and pitiless, 
Feeds at my heart's red core? 
Dost love the damned, adorable sorceress? 

My soul is prey to the Irreparable, 
It gnaws with tooth accurst, 
And, termite-like, the cunning spawn of hell 
Mines the foundations first! 
My soul is prey to the Irreparable! 

II 

Often within a theatre I have seen, 
'Thwart the orchestral roar, 
A dazzling Fairy stand in sudden sheen 
Where all was gloom before! 
Often within a theatre I have seen 

A being made of light and gold and gauze 
Fling Demons to their fate! 
But on my heart's dark stage an endless pause 
Is all, and I await 
In vain, in vain the Spirit with wings of gauze!
