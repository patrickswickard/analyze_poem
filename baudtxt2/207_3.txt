Semper Eadem

"Whence," ask you, "does this strange new sadness flow
Like rising tides on rocks, black, bare, and vast?"
For human hearts, when vintage-time is past,
To live is bad. That secret all men know -- 

An obvious sorrow, with no mystery, shown, 
Clear as your joy, to everyone around. 
O curious one, seek nothing more profound, 
And speak not, though your voice be sweet in tone.

Hush, ignorant! Hush, soul that's still enraptured, 
And mouth of childish laughter! Neatly captured, 
Death pulls us, more than life, with subtle wile.

Oh let my thought get drunk upon a lie, 
And plunge, as in a dream, in either eye, 
And in their lashes' shadow sleep awhile!
