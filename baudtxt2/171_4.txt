The Revenant

Like angels with bright savage eyes 
I will come treading phantom-wise 
Hither where thou art wont to sleep, 
Amid the shadows hollow and deep.

And I will give thee, my dark one, 
Kisses as icy as the moon, 
Caresses as of snakes that crawl 
In circles round a cistern's wall.

When morning shows its livid face
There will be no-one in my place,
And a strange cold will settle here

Others, not knowing what thou art, 
May think to reign upon thy heart 
With tenderness; I trust to fear.
