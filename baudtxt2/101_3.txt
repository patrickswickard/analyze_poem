The Sun

Along the outskirts where, close-sheltering 
Hid lusts, dilapidated shutters swing, 
When the sun strikes, redoubling waves of heat 
On town, and field, and roof, and dusty street -- 
I prowl to air my prowess and kill time, 
Stalking, in likely nooks, the odds of rhyme, 
Tripping on words like cobbles as I go 
And bumping into lines dreamed long ago.

This all-providing Sire, foe to chloroses, 
Wakes verses in the fields as well as roses 
Evaporates one's cares into the breeze, 
Filling with honey brains and hives of bees, 
Rejuvenating those who go on crutches 
And bringing youthful joy to all he touches, 
Life to those precious harvests he imparts 
That grow and ripen in our deathless hearts.

Poet-like, through the town he seems to smile 
Ennobling fate for all that is most vile; 
And king-like, without servants or display, 
Through hospitals and mansions makes his way.
