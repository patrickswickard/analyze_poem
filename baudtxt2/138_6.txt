To Her Who Is Too Gay

Your head, your gesture, your air
Are beautiful as a beautiful landscape; 
The smile plays in your face 
Like a fresh wind in a clear sky.

The fleeting care that you brush against 
Is dazzled by the health 
Which leaps like clarity 
From your arms and your shoulders.

The re-echoing colors 
Which you scatter in your toilet 
Cast in the hearts of poets 
The image of a ballet of flowers.

These silly clothes are the emblem
Of your many-colored spirit;
Silly woman of my infatuation,
I hate as much as love you!

Sometimes in a pretty garden 
Where I dragged my weakness, 
I have felt the sun like irony 
Tear my chest;

And the spring and the green of things 
Have so humbled my heart, 
That I have punished a flower 
For the insolence of Nature.

Thus I would wish, one night,
When the voluptuary's hour sounds,
To crawl like a coward, noiselessly,
Towards the treasures of your body,

In order to correct your gay flesh
And beat your unbegrudging breast,
To make upon your starting thigh
A long and biting weal,

And, sweet giddiness,
Along those newly-gaping lips
More vivid and more beautiful,
Inject my venom, O my sister!
