My Former Life

I can remember a country of long, high colonnades 
Which mirrored in their pale marble the prismatic light 
Cast from the bright sea billows in a thousand shades, 
And which resembled a cave of fluted basalt by night.

The ocean, strewn with sliding images of the sky, 
Would mingle in a mysterious and solemn way, 
Under the wild brief sunsets, its tremendous cry 
With the reflected colors of the ruined day.

There did I dwell in quiet luxury apart,
Amid the slowly changing hues of clouds and waves; 
And there I was attended by two naked slaves

Who sometimes fanned me with great fronds on either side, 
And whose sole task was to let sink into my heart 
The dolorous and beautiful secret of which I died.
