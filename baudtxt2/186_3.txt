The Metamorphoses of the Vampire

The crimson-fruited mouth that I desired -- 
While, like a snake on coals, she twinged and twired, 
Kneading her breasts against her creaking busk -- 
Let fall those words impregnated with musk, 
-- "My lips are humid: by my learned science, 
All conscience, in my bed, becomes compliance. 
My breasts, triumphant, staunch all tears; for me 
Old men, like little children, laugh with glee. 
For those who see me naked, I replace 
Sun, moon, the sky, and all the stars in space. 
I am so skilled, dear sage, in arts of pleasure, 
That, when with man my deadly arms I measure, 
Or to his teeth and kisses yield my bust, 
Timid yet lustful, fragile, yet robust, 
On sheets that swoon with passion -- you might see 
Impotent angels damn themselves for me."

When of my marrow she had sucked each bone 
And, languishing, I turned with loving moan 
To kiss her in return, with overplus,
She seemed a swollen wineskin, full of pus. 
I shut my eyes with horror at the sight, 
But when I opened them, in the clear light, 
I saw, instead of the great swollen doll 
That, bloated with my lifeblood, used to loll, 
The debris of a skeleton, assembling 
With shrill squawks of a weathercock, lie trembling, 
Or sounds, with which the howling winds commingle, 
Of an old Inn-sign on a rusty tringle.
