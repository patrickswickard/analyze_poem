The Two Good Sisters

Debauchery and Death are two lovable girls, 
Lavish with their kisses and rich with health, 
Whose ever-virgin loins, draped with tattered clothes and 
Burdened with constant work, have never given birth.

To the sinister poet, foe of families, 
Poorly paid courtier, favorite of hell, 
Graves and brothels show beneath their bowers 
A bed in which remorse has never slept.

The bier and the alcove, fertile in blasphemies 
Like two good sisters, offer to us in turn 
Terrible pleasures and frightful sweetness.

When will you bury me, Debauch with the filthy arms? 
Death, her rival in charms, when will you come 
To graft black cypress on her infected myrtle?
