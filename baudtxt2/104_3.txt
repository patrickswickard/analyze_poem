<i>I Love the Thought of Those Old Naked Days</i>

I love the thought of those old naked days 
When Phoebus gilded torsos with his rays, 
When men and women sported, strong and fleet, 
Without anxiety or base deceit, 
And heaven caressed them, amorously keen 
To prove the health of each superb machine. 
Cybele then was lavish of her guerdon 
And did not find her sons too gross a burden: 
But, like a she-wolf, in her love great-hearted, 
Her full brown teats to all the world imparted. 
Bold, handsome, strong, Man, rightly, might evince 
Pride in the glories that proclaimed him prince -- 
Fruits pure of outrage, by the blight unsmitten, 
With firm, smooth flesh that cried out to be bitten.

Today the Poet, when he would assess 
Those native splendours in the nakedness 
Of man or woman, feels a sombre chill 
Enveloping his spirit and his will. 
He meets a gloomy picture, which be loathes, 
Wherein deformity cries out for clothes. 
Oh comic runts! Oh horror of burlesque! 
Lank, flabby, skewed, pot-bellied, and grotesque! 
Whom their smug god, Utility (poor brats!) 
Has swaddled in his brazen clouts "ersatz" 
As with cheap tinsel. Women tallow-pale, 
Both gnawed and nourished by debauch, who trail 
The heavy burden of maternal vice, 
Or of fecundity the hideous price.

We have (corrupted nations) it is true
Beauties the ancient people never knew -- 
Sad faces gnawed by cancers of the heart
And charms which morbid lassitudes impart. 
But these inventions of our tardy muse 
Can't force our ailing peoples to refuse 
Just tribute to the holiness of youth 
With its straightforward mien, its forehead couth, 
The limpid gaze, like running water bright, 
Diffusing, careless, through all things, like the light 
Of azure skies, the birds, the winds, the flowers, 
The songs, and perfumes, and heart-warming powers.
