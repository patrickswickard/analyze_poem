Ill-Luck

O Sisyphus, thy strength were meet 
A load so heavy to sustain; 
The soul for work is very fain, 
But Art is long, and Time is fleet. 

Towards a lonely cemetery 
From all famed sepulchres apart. 
Like to a muffled drum my heart 
Beats funeral marches ceaselessly. 

Jewels many and many a one 
Lie hid in dark oblivion 
Far, far from pick or plummet's ken; 

Many sweet flowers' scented breath 
Is lavished till they fade in death 
In solitudes untrod by men.
