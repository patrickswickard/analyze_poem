Head of Hair

O fleecy hair, falling in curls to the shoulders! 
O black locks! O perfume laden with nonchalance! 
Ecstasy! To people the dark alcove tonight 
With memories sleeping in that thick head of hair. 
I would like to shake it in the air like a scarf!

Sweltering Africa and languorous Asia, 
A whole far-away world, absent, almost defunct, 
Dwells in your depths, aromatic forest! 
While other spirits glide on the wings of music, 
Mine, O my love! floats upon your perfume.

I shall go there, where trees and men, full of vigor, 
Are plunged in a deep swoon by the heat of the land; 
Heady tresses be the billows that carry me away! 
Ebony sea, you hold a dazzling dream 
Of rigging, of rowers, of pennons and of masts:

A clamorous harbor where my spirit can drink 
In great draughts the perfume, the sound and the color; 
Where the vessels gliding through the gold and the moire 
Open wide their vast arms to embrace the glory 
Of a clear sky shimmering with everlasting heat.

I shall bury my head enamored with rapture
In this black sea where the other is imprisoned;
And my subtle spirit caressed by the rolling
Will find you once again, O fruitful indolence,
Endless lulling of sweet-scented leisure!

Blue-black hair, pavilion hung with shadows, 
You give back to me the blue of the vast round sky; 
In the downy edges of your curling tresses 
I ardently get drunk with the mingled odors 
Of oil of coconut, of musk and tar.

A long time! Forever! my hand in your thick mane 
Will scatter sapphires, rubies and pearls, 
So that you will never be deaf to my desire! 
Aren't you the oasis of which I dream, the gourd 
From which I drink deeply, the wine of memory?
