Music

Music often transports me like a sea!
Toward my pale star,
Under a ceiling of fog or a vast ether, 
I get under sail;

My chest thrust out and my lungs filled
Like the canvas,
I scale the slopes of wave on wave 
That the night obscures;

I feel vibrating within me all the passions 
Of ships in distress;
The good wind and the tempest with its convulsions

Over the vast gulf
Cradle me. At other times, dead calm, great mirror 
Of my despair!
