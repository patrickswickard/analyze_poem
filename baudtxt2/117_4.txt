The Ideal

No beauties such as figure in vignettes, 
Monsters of a vain era's lame design, 
With feet for buskins, hands for castanets, 
Can ever satisfy a heart like mine. 
I leave to Gavarni's chlorotic Muse 
These sickly prattling nymphs, however real; 
Not one of these pale roses would I choose 
To match the flowers of my red ideal.

What my heart, deep as an abyss, demands, 
Lady Macbeth, is your brave bloody hands, 
And, Aeschylus, your dreams of rage and fright, 
Or you, vast Night, daughter of Angelo's, 
Who peacefully twist into a strange pose 
Charms fashioned for a Titan's mouth to bite.
