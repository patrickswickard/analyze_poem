The Cask of Hate

The Cask of the pale Danaids is Hate. 
Vainly Revenge, with red strong arms employed, 
Precipitates her buckets, in a spate 
Of blood and tears, to feed the empty void.

The Fiend bores secret holes to these abysms 
By which a thousand years of sweat and strain 
Escape, though she'd revive their organisms 
In order just to bleed them once again.

Hate is a drunkard in a tavern staying, 
Who feels his thirst born of its very cure, 
Like Lerna's hydra, multiplied by slaying.

Gay drinkers of their conqueror are sure, 
And Hate is doomed to a sad fate, unable 
Ever to fall and snore beneath the table.
