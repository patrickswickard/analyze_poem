The Fleece

O shadowy fleece that falls and curls upon those bare
Lithe shoulders! O rich perfume of forgetfulness!
O ecstasy! To loose upon the midnight air
The memories asleep in this tumultuous hair,
I long to rake it in my fingers, tress by tress!

Asia the languorous, the burning solitude 
Of Africa -- a whole world, distant, all but dead -- 
Survives in thy profundities, O odorous wood! 
My soul, as other souls put forth on the deep flood 
Of music, sails away upon thy scent instead.

There where the sap of life mounts hot in man and tree, 
And lush desire untamed swoons in the torrid zone, 
Undulant tresses, wild strong waves, oh, carry me! 
Dream, like a dazzling sun, from out this ebony sea 
Rises; and sails and banks of rowers propel me on.

All the confusion, all the mingled colors, cries, 
Smells of a busy port, upon my senses beat; 
Where smoothly on the golden streaked ripples flies 
The barque, its arms outspread to gather in the skies, 
Against whose glory trembles the unabating heat.

In this black ocean where the primal ocean roars,
Drunken, in love with drunkenness, I plunge and drown;
Over my dubious spirit the rolling tide outpours
Its peace -- oh, fruitful indolence, upon thy shores,
Cradled in languor, let me drift and lay me down!

Blue hair, darkness made palpable, like the big tent 
Of desert sky all glittering with many a star 
Thou coverest me -- oh, I am drugged as with the blent 
Effluvia of a sleeping caravan, the scent 
Of coco oil impregnated with musk and tar.

Fear not! Upon this savage mane for ever thy lord 
Will sow pearls, sapphires, rubies, every stone that gleams, 
To keep thee faithful! Art not thou the sycamored 
Oasis whither my thoughts journey, and the dark gourd 
Whereof I drink in long slow draughts the wine of dreams?
