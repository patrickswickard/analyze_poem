Portrait

Disease and Death make ashes out of all 
The fires that flamed for us, out of the round 
Wide eyes, so fervent and so kind withal, 
Out of the mouth wherein my heart was drowned, 
Out of our kisses, strong as pepperwort, 
Out of throes bright as patterns sunbeams etch.
What is left now? What dreadful last resort, 
O Soul? Only a faint three-colored sketch 

Which is, like me, a lonely dying thing, 
And which that oldster Time with scornful heart 
Bruises each day beneath his jagged wing.
Slayer of Life and murderer of Art, 
Mine, still, one treasure you shall not destroy: 
She who was all my glory and my joy!
