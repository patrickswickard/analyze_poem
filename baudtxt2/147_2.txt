The Beautiful Ship

I want to name for you, indolent sorceress! 
The divers marks of beauty which adorn your youth; 
I want to describe your beauty, 
In which are blended childhood and maturity.

When you go sweeping by in your full, flowing skirts, 
You resemble a trim ship as it puts to sea 
Under full sail and goes rolling 
Lazily, to a slow and easy rhythm.

On your large, round neck, on your plump shoulders, 
Your head moves proudly and with a strange grace; 
With a placid, triumphant air 
You go your way, majestic child.

I want to name for you, indolent sorceress! 
The divers marks of beauty which adorn your youth; 
I want to describe your beauty, 
In which are blended childhood and maturity.

Your exuberant breast which swells your silken gown,
Your triumphant breast is a lovely cabinet
Whose panels, round and bright,
Catch each flash of light like bucklers,

Exciting bucklers, armed with rosy points!
Cabinet of sweet secrets, crowded with good things,
With wines, with perfumes, with liqueurs
That would make delirious the minds and hearts of men!

When you go sweeping by in your full, flowing skirts,
You resemble a trim ship as it puts to sea
Under full sail and goes rolling 
Lazily, to a slow and easy rhythm.

Your shapely legs beneath the flounces they pursue
Arouse and torment obscure desires
Like two sorceresses who stir 
A black philtre in a deep vessel.

Your arms which would scorn precocious Hercules
Are the worthy rivals of glistening boas,
Made to clasp stubbornly
Your lover, as if to imprint him on your heart.

On your large, round neck, on your plump shoulders, 
Your head moves proudly and with a strange grace;
With a placid, triumphant air 
You go your way, majestic child.
