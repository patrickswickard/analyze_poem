The Murderer's Wine

My wife is dead and I am free, 
Now I may drink to my content; 
When I came back without a cent 
Her piteous outcries tortured me. 

Now I am happy as a king, 
The air is pure, the sky is clear; 
Just such a summer as that year, 
When first I went a-sweethearting. 

A horrible thirst is tearing me, 
To quench it I should have to swill 
Just as much cool wine as would fill 
Her tomb -- that's no small quantity. 

I threw her down and then began 
To pile upon her where she fell 
All the great stones around the well -- 
I shall forget it if I can. 

By all the soft vows of our prime, 
By those eternal oaths we swore, 
And that our love might be once more 
As 'twas in our old passionate time, 

I begged her in a lonely spot 
To come and meet me at nightfall; 
She came, mad creature -- we are all 
More or less crazy, are we not? 

She was quite pretty still, my wife, 
Though she was very tired, and I, 
I loved her too much, that is why 
I said to her, "Come, quit this life."

No one can grasp my thought aright; 
Did any of these sodden swine 
Ever conceive a shroud of wine 
On his most strangely morbid night? 

Dull and insensible above 
Iron machines, that stupid crew, 
Summer or winter, never knew 
The agonies of real love. 

So now I am without a care! 
Dead-drunk this evening I shall be, 
Then fearlessly, remorselessly 
Shall lie out in the open air. 

And sleep there like a homeless cur; 
Some cart may rumble with a load 
Of stones or mud along the road 
And crush my head -- I shall not stir. 

Some heavy dray incontinent 
May come and cut me clean in two: 
I laugh at thought o't as I do 
At Devil, God, and Sacrament.
