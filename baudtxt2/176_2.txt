The Pipe

I am the pipe of an author; 
One sees by my color, 
Abyssinian or Kaffir, 
That my master's a great smoker.

When he is laden with sorrow, 
I smoke like a cottage 
Where they are preparing dinner 
For the return of the ploughman.

I clasp and lull his soul 
In the wavy blue web 
That rises from my fiery mouth.

I give forth clouds of dittany 
That warm his heart and cure 
His mind of its fatigue.
