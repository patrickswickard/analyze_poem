Afternoon Song

O witch with sharp alluring eyes, 
Although your evil eyebrows lend 
Your strange ways little of the friend 
And even less of angel skies, 

How I adore your madcap verve, 
How deeply rooted, my fell passion! 
I worship you in the rapt fashion 
Of priests for idols that they serve. 

Your stiff dense tresses fragrantly 
Conjure up wilderness and wood, 
Your head assumes each attitude 
Of the enigma and its key. 

Perfumes cling closely to your flesh 
As incense to a censer; bright 
And dusky nymph, you are all Night, 
Secret and passionate and fresh! 

The strongest philter vies in vain 
Power against your languidness, 
Too well you know the sweet caress 
That brings the dead to life again. 

Your haunches are enamored of 
Your supple back and surging breast, 
And when, posed torpidly, you rest, 
Your cushions taste the charms of love.

Sometimes to quell the rageful fire 
Of your mysterious lust, you lavish 
Obstinate kiss and bite to ravish 
The throbbing prey of your desire.

You rend my body to its seams, 
Dark beauty, with your mocking laughter, 
Then fill my heart a moment after 
With glances soft as the moon's beams.

Under your satin slippers, see,
Under your blest silk feet, I lay
The vast sum of my joys today,
My genius, my destiny,

My soul, enlivened by your spark 
Your radiance and color, sweet 
Explosion of fierce tropic heat 
Across my chill Siberian dark!
