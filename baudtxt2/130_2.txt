<i>One Night I Lay with a Frightful Jewess</i>

One night I lay with a frightful Jewess, 
Like a cadaver stretched out beside a cadaver, 
And I began to muse, by that peddled body, 
About the sad beauty my desire forgoes.

I pictured to myself her native majesty, 
Her gaze with power and with grace endowed, 
The hair which forms for her a perfumed casque, 
And whose souvenir awakens love's desire.

For I would fervently have kissed your fair body 
And spread out the treasure of soulful caresses 
From your cool feet up to your tresses black,

If, some night, with a tear evoked without effort 
You could only, queen of cruel women! 
Soften the brilliancy of your cold eyes.
