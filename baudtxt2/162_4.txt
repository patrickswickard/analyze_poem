Mists and Rains

O ends of autumn, winters, springtimes deep in mud, 
Seasons of drowsiness, -- my love and gratitude 
I give you, that have wrapped with mist my heart and brain 
As with a shroud, and shut them in a tomb of rain.

In this wide land when coldly blows the bleak south-west 
And weathervanes at night grow hoarse on the house-crest, 
Better than in the time when green things bud and grow 
My mounting soul spreads wide its black wings of a crow.

The heart filled up with gloom, and to the falling sleet
Long since accustomed, finds no other thing more sweet -- 
O dismal seasons, queens of our sad climate crowned -- 

Than to remain always in your pale shadows drowned; 
(Unless it be, some dark night, kissing an unseen head, 
To rock one's pain to sleep upon a hazardous bed.)
