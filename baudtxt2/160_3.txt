Spleen

I'm like the King of some damp, rainy clime, 
Grown impotent and old before my time, 
Who scorns the bows and scrapings of his teachers 
And bores himself with hounds and all such creatures. 
Naught can amuse him, falcon, steed, or chase: 
No, not the mortal plight of his whole race 
Dying before his balcony. The tune, 
Sung to this tyrant by his pet buffoon, 
Irks him. His couch seems far more like a grave. 
Even the girls, for whom all kings seem brave, 
Can think no toilet up, nor shameless rig, 
To draw a smirk from this funereal prig. 
The sage who makes him gold, could never find 
The baser element that rots his mind. 
Even those blood-baths the old Romans knew 
And later thugs have imitated too, 
Can't warm this skeleton to deeds of slaughter, 
Whose only blood is Lethe's cold, green water.
