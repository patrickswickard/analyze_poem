Sorrow of the Moon

More drowsy dreams the moon tonight. She rests 
Like a proud beauty on heaped cushions pressing, 
With light and absent-minded touch caressing, 
Before she sleeps, the contour of her breasts.

On satin-shimmering, downy avalanches 
She dies from swoon to swoon in languid change, 
And lets her eyes on snowy visions range 
That in the azure rise like flowering branches.

When sometimes to this earth her languor calm
Lets streak a stealthy tear, a pious poet,
The enemy of sleep, in his cupped palm,

Takes this pale tear, of liquid opal spun 
With rainbow lights, deep in his heart to stow it 
Far from the staring eyeballs of the Sun.
