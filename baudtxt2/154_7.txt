Moesta et errabunda

say, Agatha, dost thou in dreams delight
-- far, far from Paris, black and miry sea --
to rove where other oceans burst in light,
blue, deep, and crystal-clear as chastity?
say, Agatha, dost thou in dreams delight?

the vast, vast ocean is our comforter!
what demon gave the hoarse resounding sea
-- and the gruff winds' great organ made for her --
that siren voice to soothe our misery?
the vast, vast ocean is our comforter!

bear me away, swift car and frigate smart!
afar! -- afar! this mire is made of tears!
-- Agatha, truly does thy mournful heart
cry out: afar from sin, remorse and fears,
bear me away, swift car and frigate smart!

how far from us that fragrant Eden lies,
where all is azure clear and love and joy,
where all we loved was worthy in love's eyes,
where hearts were drowned in bliss without alloy!
how far from us that fragrant Eden lies!

but the green Eden of our earliest loves
-- songs, roses, races, with a kiss to win,
the jugs of wine at dusk in shadowy groves
where died, afar, a quivering violin,
-- but the green Eden of our earliest loves,

our Eden of pure tremulous joy and bliss
-- is it now farther than the Asian shore?
can tears or cries recall each magic kiss,
or prayers or silvery words some eve restore
our Eden of pure tremulous joy and bliss?
