A Bed of Shame

One night I lay, a hideous Jewess at my side, 
We were stretched out, corpse to like corpse, on my cold bed,
And all my thoughts, leaving this foul bought body, sped 
To that sad beauty whom my own desire denied. 
I pictured all her native majesty, her pride, 
Her glance in all its force and grace and subtlety, 
Her hair, a perfumed casque, and the mere memory 
Rekindled my love's thirst, ever unsatisfied.

I would have kissed your queenly body fervently, 
Spreading the treasures of my rapturous caresses 
Upward from your cool feet to your warm onyx tresses, 
If some night with a tear bestowed effortlessly 
You could, O queen of cruel women, that I prize, 
Obscure the glacial splendor of your scornful eyes.
