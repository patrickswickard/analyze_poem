The Cat

I

A fine strong gentle cat is prowling 
As in his bedroom, in my brain; 
So soft his voice, so smooth its strain, 
That you can scarcely hear him miowling.

But should he venture to complain 
Or scold, the voice is rich and deep: 
And thus he manages to keep 
The charm of his untroubled reign.

This voice, which seems to pearl and filter 
Through my soul's inmost shady nook, 
Fills me with poems, like a book, 
And fortifies me, like a philtre.

His voice can cure the direst pain 
And it contains the rarest raptures. 
The deepest meanings, which it captures, 
It needs no language to explain.

There is no bow that can so sweep
That perfect instrument, my heart:
Or make more sumptuous music start
From its most vibrant cord and deep,

Than can the voice of this strange elf,
This cat, bewitching and seraphic,
Subtly harmonious in his traffic
With all things else, and with himself.

So sweet a perfume seems to swim 
Out of his fur both brown and bright, 
I nearly was embalmed one night 
From (only once) caressing him.

Familiar Lar of where I stay, 
He rules, presides, inspires and teaches 
All things to which his empire reaches. 
Perhaps he is a god, or fay.

When to a cherished cat my gaze
Is magnet-drawn and then returns
Back to itself, it there discerns,
With strange excitement and amaze,

Deep down in my own self, the rays 
Of living opals, torch-like gleams 
And pallid fire of eyes, it seems, 
That fixedly return my gaze.
