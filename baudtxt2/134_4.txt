<i>Je te donne ces vers afin que si mon nom</i>

these lines to thee, that if my name should come
to some far harbour, on a favouring main,
and ride the gale to Time's Elysium,
with all its freight of dreams to fret the brain,

that thy report, like legends vague and vain,
may tire my reader as a mighty drum,
and linked in mystic union, may become
a symbol married to my haughty strain;

-- accursed one, to whom, from deepest skies
down to the Pit, naught, save my heart, replies!
-- o thou who like a ghost impalpable

tramplest upon, serenely as a bonze
the stupid mortals who denied thy spell
-- cold jet-eyed statue, angel cast in bronze!
