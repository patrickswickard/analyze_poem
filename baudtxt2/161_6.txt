Spleen

When the low heavy sky weighs like a lid 
Upon the spirit aching for the light, 
And all the wide horizon's line is hid 
By a black day sadder than any night; 

When the changed earth is but a dungeon dank 
Where batlike Hope goes blindly fluttering 
And, striking wall and roof and mouldered plank, 
Bruises his tender head and timid wing; 

When like grim prison-bars stretch down the thin, 
Straight, rigid pillars of the endless rain, 
And the dumb throngs of infamous spiders spin 
Their meshes in the caverns of the brain; -- 

Suddenly, bells leap forth into the air, 
Hurling a hideous uproar to the sky 
As 'twere a band of homeless spirits who fare 
Through the strange heavens, wailing stubbornly. 

And hearses, without drum or instrument, 
File slowly through my soul; crushed, sorrowful, 
Weeps Hope, and Grief, fierce and omnipotent, 
Plants his black banner on my drooping skull.
