The Ghost

Like angels with wild beast's eyes 
I shall return to your bedroom 
And silently glide toward you 
With the shadows of the night;

And, dark beauty, I shall give you 
Kisses cold as the moon 
And the caresses of a snake 
That crawls around a grave.

When the livid morning comes, 
You'll find my place empty, 
And it will be cold there till night.

I wish to hold sway over 
Your life and youth by fear, 
As others do by tenderness.
