The Beacons

Rubens, river of oblivion, garden of indolence, 
Pillow of cool flesh where one cannot love, 
But where life moves and whirls incessantly 
Like the air in the sky and the tide in the sea;

Leonardo, dark, unfathomable mirror, 
In which charming angels, with sweet smiles 
Full of mystery, appear in the shadow 
Of the glaciers and pines that enclose their country;

Rembrandt, gloomy hospital filled with murmuring, 
Ornamented only with a large crucifix, 
Lit for a moment by a wintry sun, 
Where from rot and ordure rise tearful prayers;

Angelo, shadowy place where Hercules' are seen 
Mingling with Christs, and rising straight up, 
Powerful phantoms, which in the twilights 
Rend their winding-sheets with outstretched fingers;

Boxer's wrath, shamelessness of Fauns, you whose genius 
Showed to us the beauty in a villain, 
Great heart filled with pride, sickly, yellow man, 
Puget, melancholy emperor of galley slaves;

Watteau, carnival where the loves of many famous hearts
Flutter capriciously like butterflies with gaudy wings;
Cool, airy settings where the candelabras' light
Touches with madness the couples whirling in the dance

Goya, nightmare full of unknown things, 
Of fetuses roasted in the midst of witches' sabbaths, 
Of old women at the mirror and of nude children, 
Tightening their hose to tempt the demons;

Delacroix, lake of blood haunted by bad angels, 
Shaded by a wood of fir-trees, ever green, 
Where, under a gloomy sky, strange fanfares 
Pass, like a stifled sigh from Weber;

These curses, these blasphemies, these lamentations, 
These Te Deums, these ecstasies, these cries, these tears, 
Are an echo repeated by a thousand labyrinths; 
They are for mortal hearts a divine opium.

They are a cry passed on by a thousand sentinels,
An order re-echoed through a thousand megaphones;
They are a beacon lighted on a thousand citadels,
A call from hunters lost deep in the woods!

For truly, Lord, the clearest proofs 
That we can give of our nobility, 
Are these impassioned sobs that through the ages roll, 
And die away upon the shore of your Eternity.
