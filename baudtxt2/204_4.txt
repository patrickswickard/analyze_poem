The Duel

Two warriors dueled upon the battle ground, 
Their arms scattering bright sparks and blood; above 
This sport, the clash of steel gave forth the sound 
Of youth fallen a prey to puling love.

The blades are broken, darling, like the moon 
Of our sweet youth! but teeth and fingernails 
Avenge the sword and traitorous dagger soon.
Old hearts that love's old bitterness assails!

In the ravine where lynx and panther ramble, 
Our heroes bite the dust in fierce embrace, 
Their skin shall bring new bloom to the dry bramble. 
This pit is hell, our friends' choice dwelling place! 
Let us roll there, O cruel Amazon, 
So our fierce hatred may live on and on!
