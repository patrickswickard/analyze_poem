<i>With Waving Opalescence in Her Gown</i>

With waving opalescence in her gown, 
Even when she walks along, you think she's dancing. 
Like those long snakes which charmers, while entrancing,
Wave with their wands, in cadence, up and down.

Like the sad sands of deserts and their skies,
By human sufferings untouched and free,
Or like the surfy curtains of the sea,
She flaunts a cold indifference. Her eyes

Are made of charming minerals well-burnished. 
Her nature, both by sphynx and angel furnished, 
Is old, intact, symbolic, and bizarre:

She seems, made all of gems, steel, light, and gold, 
In barrenness, majestic, hard, and cold, 
To blaze forever, like a useless star.
