Misty Sky

One would have thought your eyes were veiled in haze 
Strange eyes! (Grey, green, or azure is their gaze?) 
It seems they would reflect, in each renewal, 
The changing skies, dull, dreamy, fond, or cruel.

You know those days both warm and hazy, which 
Melt into tears the hearts that they bewitch: 
And when the nerves, uneasy to control, 
Too-wide awake, upbraid the sleeping soul.

You, too, resemble such a lit horizon 
As suns of misty seasons now bedizen...
As you shine out, a landscape fresh with rain 
With misty sunbeams sparkling on the plain.

Dangerous girl, seductive as the weather! 
Shall I adore your snows and frosts together? 
In your relentless winter shall I feel 
A kiss more sharp than that of ice and steel?
