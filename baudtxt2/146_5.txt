The Cat

I

Along my brain there walks,
As though in its own home,
A lovely, strong and sweet and charming cat.
When it mews, one hardly hears,

So tender and discreet its tone; 
Appeasing or complaining its voice 
Is always rich and deep: 
Therein is its charm and secret.

This voice, which glistens and strains 
Through the darkest soils of my being, 
Satiates me like an harmonious line, 
Delights me like a philter.

It lulls to sleep most cruel ills 
And holds all ecstasy; 
To tell the longest phrase, 
It has no need of words.

No, there is no bow that gnaws
On my heart, perfect instrument,
To make more regally sing
The most vibrant string,

Than your voice, mysterious,
Seraphic, strange cat,
In whom all is, like an angel,
As subtle as harmonious!

From its fair and dark fur 
Comes a scent so gentle, that one night 
I was caught in its balm, by having 
Caressed it once, only once.

It is the familiar spirit of the place; 
It judges, presides, inspires 
Everything in its empire; 
It is perhaps a fairy or a god?

When my eyes, drawn like a magnet
To this cat that I love,
Come meekly back again
And I look inside myself,

I see with amazement 
The fire of its pale pupils, 
Clear beacons, living opals, 
Looking at me fixedly.
