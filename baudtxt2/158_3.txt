Spleen

The Month of Rains, incensed at life, outpours 
Out of her urn, a dark chill, like a penance, 
Over the graveyards and their wan, grey tenants 
And folk in foggy suburbs out of doors.

My cat seeks out a litter on the ground 
Twitching her scrawny body flecked with mange. 
The soul of some old poet seems to range 
The gutter, with a chill phantasmal sound.

The big bell tolls: damp hearth-logs seem to mock,
Whistling, the sniffle-snuffle of the clock,
While in the play of odours stale with must,

Reminders of a dropsical old crone, 
The knave of hearts and queen of spades alone 
Darkly discuss a passion turned to dust.
