The Evil Monk

The walls of cloisters on their frescoed lath
Displayed, in pictures, sacred truths of old,
Whose sight would warm the entrails of one's faith
To temper their austerity and cold.

In times when every sowing flowered for Christ 
Lived famous monks, now out of memory's reach; 
The graveyard for their library sufficed, 
And Death was glorified in simple speech.

My soul's a grave, where, evil cenobite, 
To all eternity I have been banned. 
Nothing adorns this cloister full of spite.

O idle monk! Say, to what end were planned 
The living spectacle of my sad plight, 
Love of my eye, or labour of my hand?
