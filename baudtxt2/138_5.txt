A Celle Qui Est Trop Gaie

Your head, your stance, your airy grace 
Are as a landscape in July, 
Blithe laughter plays upon your face 
Like a cool wind in a clear sky.

The sorry passerby you sight 
Is dazzled by the glowing charms 
That issue in a radiant light 
Over your shoulders and your arms. 

Over your blaring frocks we find 
Wild colors strewn with elegance 
That rouse within the poet's mind 
The image of a flower dance. 

Your crazy gowns are emblems of 
Your own variegated state, 
Madwoman, whom I madly love 
And whom I quite as madly hate. 

At times in gardens where, oppressed, 
I dragged my stubborn atony, 
I felt gold sunlight rend my breast 
As if in bitter raillery. 

Both springtime and its verdant bowers 
So mortified my heart and sense 
That I chastised the budding flowers 
Because of Nature's insolence. 

Thus I should like some night, when deep 
The hour tolls out for hidden pleasures, 
Softly and cravenly to creep 
Close to your body's lavish treasures.
