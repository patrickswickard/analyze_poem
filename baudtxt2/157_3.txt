The Cracked Bell

It's sweet and bitter, of a winter night, 
To hear, beside the crackling, smoking log, 
Far memories prepare themselves for flight 
To carillons that sound amid the fog.

Happy's the bell whose vigorous throat on high, 
in spite of time, is sound and still unspent, 
To hurl his faithful and religious cry 
Like an old soldier watching in his tent.

My soul is cracked, and when amidst its care 
It tries with song to fill the frosty air, 
Sometimes, its voice seems like the feeble croak

A wounded soldier makes, lost in the smoke, 
Beneath a pile of dead, in bloody mire, 
Trying, with fearful efforts, to expire.
