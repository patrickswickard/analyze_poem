Dawn

They were sounding reveille in the barracks' yards, 
And the morning wind was blowing on the lanterns.

It was the hour when swarms of harmful dreams 
Make the sun-tanned adolescents toss in their beds; 
When, like a bloody eye that twitches and rolls, 
The lamp makes a red splash against the light of day; 
When the soul within the heavy, fretful body 
Imitates the struggle of the lamp and the sun. 
Like a tear-stained face being dried by the breeze, 
The air is full of the shudders of things that flee, 
And man is tired of writing and woman of making love.

Here and there the houses were beginning to smoke. 
The ladies of pleasure, with eyelids yellow-green 
And mouths open, were sleeping their stupefied sleep; 
The beggar-women, their breasts hanging thin and cold, 
Were blowing on their fires, blowing on their fingers. 
It was the hour when amid poverty and cold 
The pains of women in labor grow more cruel; 
The cock's crow in the distance tore the foggy air 
Like a sob stifled by a bloody froth;

The buildings were enveloped in a sea of mist, 
And in the charity-wards, the dying 
Hiccupped their death-sobs at uneven intervals. 
The rakes were going home, exhausted by their work.

The dawn, shivering in her green and rose garment, 
Was moving slowly along the deserted Seine, 
And somber Paris, the industrious old man, 
Was rubbing his eyes and gathering up his tools.
