The Irremediable

I

A Form, Idea, or Essence, chased 
Out of the azure sky, and shot 
Into a leaden Styx where not 
A star can pierce the muddy waste:

An angel, rash explorer, who,
Tempted by love of strange deformity,
Caught in a nightmare of enormity,
Fights like a swimmer, wrestling through

A monstrous whorl of eddying spume, 
In deathly anguish, from him flinging 
The wave that, like an idiot singing, 
Goes pirouetting through the gloom:

A wretch enchanted, who, to flee
A den of serpents, gropes about 
In desperation vain, without 
Discovering a match or key:

A damned soul, who, with no lamp,
Stands by a gulf, whose humid scent
Betrays the depth of the descent
Of endless stairs without a ramp,

Where slimy monsters watch the track 
Whose eyeballs phosphoresce and glow 
Only to make the night more black 
And nought except themselves to show:

A vessel that the pole betrays, 
Caught in a crystal trap all round, 
And seeking by what fatal sound 
It ever entered such a maze: -- 

Clear emblems! measuring the level 
Of irremediable dooms, 
Which make us see bow well the Devil 
Performs whatever he presumes!

II

Strange tete-a-tete! the heart, its own
Mirror, its own confession hears!
Deep well where Truth is trembling shown
And like a livid star appears,

Ironic beacon and infernal
Torch of satanic grace, but still
Sole glory and relief eternal,
-- Conscience that operates in Ill!
