Morning Twilight

Reveille in the barracks and the camps. 
The wind of morning blew upon the lamps. 
It was the hour when evil dreams in swarms 
On pillows twist brown, adolescent forms: 
When like a bleeding eye that's twitched with pain 
Each lantern smudged the day with crimson stain: 
The soul, against its body's weight of brawn, 
Lay struggling, like the lanterns with the dawn: 
Like a sad face whose tears the breezes dry 
The air grew tremulous with things that fly, 
And women tired of love, and men of writing.

The chimneys, here and there, showed fires were lighting. 
Women of pleasure, slumber to be-slut, 
Lay open-mouthed with livid eyelids shut. 
Dangling thin dugs, cold pauper-women blew 
Upon the embers and their fingers too. 
It was the hour when, what with cold and squalor, 
Women in labour aggravate their dolour, 
And like a sob, choked short with bloody froth, 
The cock-crow tore the foggy air as cloth.

Like seas the mists round every building poured 
While agonising patients in the ward, 
In broken hiccoughs, rattled out their lives: 
And worn-out rakes reeled homeward to their wives. 
Aurora, in a shift of rose and green, 
Came shivering down the Seine's deserted scene 
And Paris, as he rubbed his eyes, began 
To sort his tools, laborious old man.
