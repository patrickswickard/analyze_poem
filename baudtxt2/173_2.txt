Sepulcher

If on a dismal, sultry night
Some good Christian, through charity,
Will bury your vaunted body
Behind the ruins of a building

At the hour when the chaste stars 
Close their eyes, heavy with sleep, 
The spider will make his webs there, 
And the viper his progeny;

You will hear all year long
Above your damned head
The mournful cries of wolves

And of the half-starved witches, 
The frolics of lustful old men 
And the plots of vicious robbers.
