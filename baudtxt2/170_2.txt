Hatred's Cask

Hatred is the cask of the pale Danaides; 
Bewildered Vengeance with arms red and strong 
Vainly pours into its empty darkness 
Great pailfuls of the blood and the tears of the dead;

The Demon makes secret holes in this abyss, 
Whence would escape a thousand years of sweat and strain, 
Even if she could revive her victims, 
Could restore their bodies, to squeeze them dry once more.

Hatred is a drunkard in a tavern, 
Who feels his thirst grow greater with each drink 
And multiply itself like the Lernaean hydra.

-- While fortunate drinkers know they can be conquered, 
Hatred is condemned to this lamentable fate, 
That she can never fall asleep beneath the table.
