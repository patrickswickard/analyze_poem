The Owls

Within the shelter of black yews 
The owls in ranks are ranged apart 
Like foreign gods, whose eyeballs dart 
Red fire. They meditate and muse.

Without a stir they will remain 
Till, in its melancholy hour, 
Thrusting the level sun from power, 
The shade establishes its reign.

Their attitude instructs the sage, 
Content with what is near at hand, 
To shun all motion, strife, and rage.

Men, crazed with shadows that they chase, 
Bear, as a punishment, the brand 
Of having wished to change their place.
