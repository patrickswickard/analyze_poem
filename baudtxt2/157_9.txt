The Cracked Bell

It is bitter and sweet, during winter nights,
To listen, beside the throbbing, smoking fire, 
To distant memories slowly ascending 
In the sound of the chimes chanting through the fog.

Blessed the bell with the vigorous gullet
Which, despite old age, watchful and healthy,
Throws out faithfully its pious tones,
Like an old soldier in vigil under his tent!

Ah, my soul is cracked, and when in sorrows
It wishes to people the cold air of the night with its songs,
Often it happens that its feeble voice

Seems like the thick death-rattle of one wounded, forgotten 
By the side of a lake of blood, under a great weight of dead, 
Who dies, without moving, amongst enormous efforts.
