Obsession

You forests, like cathedrals, are my dread: 
You roar like organs. Our curst hearts, like cells 
Where death forever rattles on the bed, 
Echo your de Profundis as it swells.

My spirit hates you, Ocean! sees, and loathes 
Its tumults in your own. Of men defeated 
The bitter laugh, that's full of sobs and oaths, 
Is in your own tremendously repeated.

How you would please me, Night! without your stars 
Which speak a foreign dialect, that jars 
On one who seeks the void, the black, the bare.

Yet even your darkest shade a canvas forms 
Whereon my eye must multiply in swarms 
Familiar looks of shapes no longer there.
