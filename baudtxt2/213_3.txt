Fantastic Engraving

A monstrous spectre carries on his forehead, 
And at a rakish tilt, grotesquely horrid, 
A crown such as at carnivals parade. 
Without a Whip or spur he rides a jade, 
A phantom-like apocalyptic moke, 
Whose nostrils seem with rabid froth to smoke. 
Across unbounded space the couple moves 
Spurning infinity with reckless hooves. 
The horseman waves a sword that lights the gloom
Of nameless crowds he tramples to their doom, 
And, like a prince his mansion, goes inspecting 
The graveyard, which, no skyline intersecting, 
Contains, beneath a sun that's white and bleak, 
Peoples of history, modem and antique.
