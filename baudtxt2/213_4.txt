Fantastic Print

This eerie specter wears no clothes at all. 
A dreadful crown, reeking of carnival, 
Sits weirdly on his naked skull. Without 
Or spurs or whip, he wears his charger out 
(A ghostly and apocalyptic nag, 
Nose foaming like an epileptic hag).
The hideous pair plunge ruthlessly through space, 
Trampling infinity at breakneck pace.

The horseman's flaming sword, as on they rush, 
Fells victims that his steed has failed to crush, 
And, like a prince inspecting his domain, 
He scans the graveyard's limitless chill plain 
Where, in a dull white sun's exhausted light, 
Lies every race since man emerged from night.
