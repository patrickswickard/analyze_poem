Skeleton with a Spade

I

In the anatomical plates
That lie about on dusty quais
Where many cadaverous books
Sleep like an ancient mummy,

Engravings to which the staidness
And knowledge of some old artist
Have communicated beauty,
Although the subject is gloomy,

One sees, and it makes more complete 
These mysteries full of horror, 
Skinless bodies and skeletons, 
Spading as if they were farmhands.

II

From the soil that you excavate,
Resigned, macabre villagers,
From all the effort of your backs,
Or of your muscles stripped of skin,

Tell me, what singular harvest, 
Convicts torn from cemeteries, 
Do you reap, and of what farmer 
Do you have to fill the barn?

Do you wish (clear, frightful symbol 
Of too cruel a destiny!) 
To show that even in the grave 
None is sure of the promised sleep;

That Annihilation betrays us;
That all, even Death, lies to us,
And that forever and ever,
Alas! we shall be forced perhaps

In some unknown country 
To scrape the hard and stony ground 
And to push a heavy spade in 
With our bare and bleeding feet?
