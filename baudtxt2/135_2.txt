All in One

The Demon called on me this morning, 
In my high room. As is his way, 
Thinking to catch me without warning, 
He put this question: "Tell me, pray,

Of all the beauties that compose,
The strange enchantment of her ways,
Amongst the wonders black or rose,
Which object most excites your praise,

And is the climax in her litany?" 
My soul, you answered the Abhorred, 
"Since she is fashioned, all, of dittany, 
No part is most to be adored.

Since I am ravished, I ignore a 
Degree of difference in delight. 
She dazzles me like the aurora 
And she consoles me like the night.

The harmony's so exquisite 
That governs her, it is in vain 
Analysis would try to split 
The unity of such a strain.

O mystic fusion that, enwreathing 
My senses, fuses each in each, 
To hear the music of her breathing 
And breathe the perfume of her speech."
