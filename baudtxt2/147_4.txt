The Beautiful Ship

I want to tell you, indolent enchantress, 
Of the various beauties that adorn your youth; 
I want to paint for you your beauty 
Of childish maturity.

When you go sweeping the air with your flaring skirts, 
You look like a lovely slip taking to flight 
Heavy with canvas, pitching, 
Rolling in a soft rhythm, both lazy and slow.

On your wide, round neck, on your plump shoulders, 
Your head parades its strange graces; 
Placidly, triumphantly, 
O child of majesty, you go your way.

I want to tell you, indolent enchantress, 
Of the various beauties that adorn your youth; 
I want to paint for you your beauty 
Where childhood touches maturity.

Your breasts thrust forward, heaving their silk, 
Your triumphing breasts are charming cases 
Whose outlined, rounded panels 
Hold flashes of light like twin shields;

Provocative shields, armed with pink tips,
Cases of sweet secrets, full of sweet things,
Of wines and perfumes and liqueurs
Making the brain, the heart delirious!

When you go sweeping the air with your flaring skirts, 
You look like a lovely ship taking to flight, 
Heavy with canvas, you go pitching, 
Rolling in a soft rhythm, both lazy and slow.

Your full legs, under flounces they chase forward, 
Torture and excite dark desires, 
Like two witches who 
Twist some black potion in a deep bowl.

Your arms, which would make light of precocious Hercules,
Rival well two glistening snakes,
Made to bind hopelessly
As if to imprison your lover in your heart.

On your wide, round neck, on your plump shoulders, 
Your head parades its strange graces 
Placid, triumphantly, 
O child of majesty, you go your way.
