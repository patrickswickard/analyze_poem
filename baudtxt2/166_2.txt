Twilight

Behold the sweet evening, friend of the criminal; 
It comes like an accomplice, stealthily; the sky 
Closes slowly like an immense alcove, 
And impatient man turns into a beast of prey. 
O evening, kind evening, desired by him 
Whose arms can say, without lying: "Today 
We labored!" -- It is the evening that comforts 
Those minds that are consumed by a savage sorrow, 
The obstinate scholar whose head bends with fatigue 
And the bowed laborer who returns to his bed.

Meanwhile in the atmosphere malefic demons 
Awaken sluggishly, like businessmen, 
And take flight, bumping against porch roofs and shutters. 
Among the gas flames worried by the wind 
Prostitution catches alight in the streets; 
Like an ant-hill she lets her workers out; 
Everywhere she blazes a secret path, 
Like an enemy who plans a surprise attack; 
She moves in the heart of the city of mire 
Like a worm that steals from Man what he eats. 
Here and there one hears food sizzle in the kitchens, 
The theaters yell, the orchestras moan;

The gambling dens, where games of chance delight, 
Fill up with whores and cardsharps, their accomplices; 
The burglars, who know neither respite nor mercy, 
Are soon going to begin their work, they also, 
And quietly force open cash-boxes and doors 
To enjoy life awhile and dress their mistresses.

Meditate, O my soul, in this solemn moment, 
And close your ears to this uproar; 
It is now that the pains of the sick grow sharper! 
Somber Night grabs them by the throat; they reach the end 
Of their destinies and go to the common pit; 
The hospitals are filled with their sighs. -- More than one 
Will come no more to get his fragrant soup 
By the fireside, in the evening, with a loved one.

However, most of them have never known 
The sweetness of a home, have never lived!
