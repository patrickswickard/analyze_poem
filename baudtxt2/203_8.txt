The Head of Hair

O Fleece, foaming to the neck!
O curls! O scent of laziness!
Ecstasy! This evening, to people the dark corners
Of memories that are sleeping in these locks,
I would wave them in the air like a handkerchief!

Languorous Asia and burning Africa, 
A whole world, distant, absent, almost extinct, 
Lives in the depths of your perfumed jungle; 
As other souls sail along on music, 
So mine, O my love, swims on your scent.

I shall go over there where trees and men, full of sap, 
Faint away slowly in the passionate climate; 
O strong locks, be the sea-swell that transports me! 
You keep, O sea of ebony, a dazzling dream 
Of sails and sailormen, flames and masts:

A resounding haven where in great waves
My soul can drink the scent, the sound and color;
Where ships, sliding in gold and watered silk,
Part their vast arms to embrace the glory
Of the pure sky shuddering with eternal heat

I shall plunge my head, adoring drunkenness,
Into this black ocean where the other is imprisoned;
And my subtle spirit caressed by the sway
Will know how to find you, O pregnant idleness!
In an infinite cradle of scented leisure!

Blue hair, house of taut darkness,
You make the blue of the sky seem huge and round for me;
On the downy edges of your twisted locks
I hungrily get drunk on the muddled fragrances
Of coconut oil, of musk and tar

For a long time! For ever! Amongst your heavy mane 
My hand will strew the ruby, pearl and sapphire 
To make you never deaf to my desire!
For are you not the oasis where I dream, the gourd 
Where in great draughts I gulp the wine of memory?
