Lethe

Come on my heart, cruel and insensible soul, 
My darling tiger, beast with indolent airs; 
I want to plunge for hours my trembling fingers 
In your thick and heavy mane;

In your petticoats filled with your perfume 
To bury my aching head, 
And breathe, like a faded flower, 
The sweet taste of my dead love.

I want to sleep, to sleep and not to live, 
In a sleep as soft as death, 
I shall cover with remorseless kisses 
Your body beautifully polished as copper.

To swallow my appeased sobbing 
I need only the abyss of your bed; 
A powerful oblivion lives on your lips, 
And all Lethe flows in your kisses.

I shall obey, as though predestined,
My destiny, that is now my delight;
Submissive martyr, innocent damned one,
My ardor inflames my torture,

And I shall suck, to drown my bitterness 
The nepenthe and the good hemlock, 
On the lovely tips of those jutting breasts 
Which have never imprisoned love.
