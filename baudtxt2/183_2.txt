The Fountain of Blood

It seems to me at times my blood flows out in waves 
Like a fountain that gushes in rhythmical sobs. 
I hear it clearly, escaping with long murmurs, 
But I feel my body in vain to find the wound.

Across the city, as in a tournament field, 
It courses, making islands of the paving stones, 
Satisfying the thirst of every creature 
And turning the color of all nature to red.

I have often asked insidious wines 
To lull to sleep for a day my wasting terror; 
Wine makes the eye sharper, the ear more sensitive!

I have sought in love a forgetful sleep; 
But love is to me only a bed of needles 
Made to slake the thirst of those cruel prostitutes!
