The Enemy

My childhood was nought but a ravaging storm, 
Enlivened at times by a brilliant sun;
The rain and the winds wrought such havoc and harm 
That of buds on my plot there remains hardly one. 

Behold now the Fall of ideas I have reached, 
And the shovel and rake one must therefore resume, 
In collecting the turf, inundated and breached, 
Where the waters dug trenches as deep as a tomb. 

And yet these new blossoms, for which I craved, 
Will they find in this earth -- like a shore that is laved --
The mystical fuel which vigour imparts? 

Oh misery! -- Time devours our lives, 
And the enemy black, which consumeth our hearts 
On the blood of our bodies, increases and thrives!
