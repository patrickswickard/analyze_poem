Beatrice

One day as I was making complaint to nature 
In a burnt, ash-gray land without vegetation, 
And as I wandered aimlessly, slowly whetting 
Upon my heart the dagger of my thought, 
I saw in broad daylight descending on my head 
A leaden cloud, pregnant with a tempest, 
That carried a herd of vicious demons 
Who resembled curious, cruel dwarfs. 
They began to look at me coldly, 
And I heard them laugh and whisper to each other, 
Exchanging many a sign and many a wink 
Like passers-by who discuss a fool they admire:

-- "Let us look leisurely at this caricature, 
This shade of Hamlet who imitates his posture 
With indecisive look, hair streaming in the wind. 
Is it not a pity to see this bon vivant, 
This tramp, this queer fish, this actor without a job, 
Because he knows how to play skillfully his role, 
Wish to interest in the song of his woes 
The eagles, the crickets, the brooks, and the flowers, 
And even to us, authors of that hackneyed drivel, 
Bellow the recital of his public tirades?"

I could have (my pride as high as mountains 
Dominates the clouds and the cries of the demons) 
Simply turned away my sovereign head 
If I had not seen in that obscene troop 
A crime which did not make the sun reel in its course! 
The queen of my heart with the peerless gaze 
Laughing with them at my somber distress 
And giving them at times a lewd caress.
