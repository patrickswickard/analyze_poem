The Mercenary Muse

O Muse of my heart, votary of palaces, 
Shall you, when January looses its boreal winds, 
Have any firebrand to warm your violet feet 
In the black boredoms of snowy evenings?

Shall you revive your marble shoulders 
By the gleams of night that stab the shutters? 
And, feeling your purse as empty as your palace, 
Will you reap the gold of azure skies?

To win your evening bread you need,
Like a choir-boy, to play with the censer,
To chant the Te Deums you scarcely believe in,

Or, famished vagabond, expose your charms 
And your laughter soaked in crying that is not seen,
In order to dispel the spleen of the people.
