To a Colonial Lady

In scented countries by the sun caressed 
I've known, beneath a tent of purple boughs, 
And palmtrees shedding slumber as they drowse, 
A creole lady with a charm unguessed.

She's pale, and warm, and duskily beguiling; 
Nobility is moulded in her neck; 
Slender and tall she holds herself in check, 
An huntress born, sure-eyed, and quiet-smiling.

Should you go, Madam, to the land of glory
Along the Seine or Loire, where you would merit
To ornament some mansion famed in story,

Your eyes would bum in those deep-shaded parts, 
And breed a thousand rhymes in poets' hearts, 
Tamed like the negro slaves that you inherit.
