The Landscape

More chasteness to my eclogues it would give, 
Sky-high, like old astrologers to live, 
A neighbour of the belfries: and to hear 
Their solemn hymns along the winds career. 
High in my attic, chin in hand, I'd swing 
And watch the workshops as they roar and sing, 
The city's masts -- each steeple, tower, and flue -- 
And skies that bring eternity to view.

Sweet, through the mist, to see illumed again 
Stars through the azure, lamps behind the pane, 
Rivers of carbon irrigate the sky, 
And the pale moon pour magic from on high. 
I'd watch three seasons passing by, and then 
When winter came with dreary snows, I'd pen 
Myself between closed shutters, bolts, and doors, 
And build my fairy palaces indoors.

A dream of blue horizons I would garble 
With thoughts of fountains weeping on to marble, 
Of gardens, kisses, birds that ceaseless sing, 
And all the Idyll holds of childhood's spring. 
The riots, brawling past my window-pane, 
From off my desk would not divert my brain. 
Because I would be plunged in pleasure still, 
Conjuring up the Springtime with my will, 
And forcing sunshine from my heart to form, 
Of burning thoughts, an atmosphere that's warm.
