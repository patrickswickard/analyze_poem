Reversibility

Angel of gaiety, have you known anguish, 
Shame and remorse, tears, boredom, and dismay, 
Vague horrors of the nights in which we languish, 
Which crumple hearts like papers thrown away? 
Angel of gaiety, have you known anguish?

Angel of kindness, have you met with hate? 
Fists clenched in gloom, eyes running tears of gall, 
When Vengeance beats his drum to subjugate 
Our faculties, the captain of them all? 
Angel of kindness, have you met with hate?

Angel of health, have you beheld the Fevers? 
Across pale walls of wards they limp and stumble, 
Like exiles wan, with agues, chills, and shivers, 
Seeking the scanty sun with lips that mumble. 
Angel of health, have you beheld the Fevers?

Angel of beauty, do you know Old Age, 
The fear of wrinkles, and the dire emotion, 
In eyes we've pierced too long, as on a page, 
To read the secret horror of devotion? 
Angel of beauty do you know Old Age?

Angel of goodness, radiance, and delight, 
The dying David would have begged to share 
The emanations of your body bright. 
But all I wish to ask of you is prayer, 
Angel of goodness, radiance, and delight.
