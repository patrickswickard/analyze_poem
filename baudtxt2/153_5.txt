To a Creole Lady

In that perfumed country caressed by the sun,
I have known, under a canopy of purple trees 
And palms raining idleness upon the eyes, 
A creole lady of private beauty.

Her shade is pale and warm; this brown enchantress 
Has gracefully mannered airs in her neck; 
Large and sinuous, walking like a huntress, 
Her smile is silent and her eyes secure.

If you should go, Madam, to the true country of glory,
On the banks of the Seine or of the green Loire,
Fair lady fit to decorate ancient mansions,

In some shady and secluded refuge, you would awake 
A thousand sonnets in the hearts of poets, 
Whom your great eyes would make more subject than your Blacks.
