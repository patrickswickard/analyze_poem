Beyond Redemption

I

An Idea, a Form, a Being 
Which left the azure sky and fell 
Into a leaden, miry Styx 
That no eye in Heaven can pierce;

An Angel, imprudent voyager
Tempted by love of the deformed,
In the depths of a vast nightmare
Flailing his arms like a swimmer,

And struggling, mortal agony! 
Against a gigantic whirlpool 
That sings constantly like madmen 
And pirouettes in the darkness;

An unfortunate, enchanted, 
Outstretched hands groping futilely, 
Looking for the light and the key, 
To flee a place filled with reptiles;

A damned soul descending endless stairs
Without banisters, without light,
On the edge of a gulf of which
The odor reveals the humid depth,

Where slimy monsters are watching, 
Whose eyes, wide and phosphorescent, 
Make the darkness darker still 
And make visible naught but themselves;

A ship caught in the polar sea 
As though in a snare of crystal, 
Seeking the fatal strait through which 
It came into that prison;

-- Patent symbols, perfect picture 
Of an irremediable fate 
Which makes one think that the Devil 
Always does well whatever he does!

II

Somber and limpid tete-a-tete -- 
A heart become its own mirror!
Well of Truth, clear and black,
Where a pale star flickers,

A hellish, ironic beacon, 
Torch of satanical blessings, 
Sole glory and only solace
-- The consciousness of doing evil.
