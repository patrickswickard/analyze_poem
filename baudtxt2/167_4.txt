Dawn

Outside the barracks now the bugle called, and woke 
The morning wind, which rose, making the lanterns smoke.

It was that hour when tortured dreams of stealthy joys 
Twist in their beds the thin brown bodies of growing boys; 
When, like a blood-shot eye that blinks and looks away, 
The lamp still burns, and casts a red stain on the day; 
When the soul, pinned beneath the body's weight and brawn, 
Strives, as the lamplight strives to overcome the dawn; 
The air, like a sad face whose tears the breezes dry, 
Is tremulous with countless things about to die; 
And men grow tired of writing, and women of making love.

Blue smoke was curling now from the cold chimneys of 
A house or two; with heavy lids, mouths open wide, 
Prostitutes slept their slumber dull and stupefied; 
While laborers' wives got up, with sucked-out breasts, and stood 
Blowing first on their hands, then on the flickering wood. 
It was that hour when cold, and lack of things they need, 
Combine, and women in childbirth have it hard indeed.

Like a sob choked by frothy hemorrhage, somewhere 
Far-off a sudden cock-crow tore the misty air; 
A sea of fog rolled in, effacing roofs and walls; 
The dying, that all night in the bare hospitals 
Had fought for life, grew weaker, rattled, and fell dead; 
And gentlemen, debauched and drunk, swayed home to bed.

Aurora now in a thin dress of green and rose, 
With chattering teeth advanced. Old somber Paris rose, 
Picked up its tools, and, over the deserted Seine, 
Yawning, rubbing its eyes, slouched forth to work again.
