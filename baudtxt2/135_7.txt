Tout Entiere

This morning in my attic high 
The Demon came to visit me, 
And seeking faults in my reply, 
He said: "I would inquire of thee, 

"Of all the beauties which compose 
Her charming body's potent spell, 
Of all the objects black and rose 
Which make the thing you love so well, 

"Which is the sweetest?" O my soul! 
Thou didst rejoin: "How tell of parts, 
When all I know is that the whole 
Works magic in my heart of hearts? 

"Where all is fair, how should I say 
What single grace is my delight? 
She shines on me like break of day 
And she consoles me as the night. 

"There flows through all her perfect frame 
A harmony too exquisite 
That weak analysis should name 
The numberless accords of it. 

"O mystic metamorphosis! 
My separate senses all are blent; 
Within her breath soft music is, 
And in her voice a subtle scent!"
