The Damned Women

Lounging like pensive cattle on the sand, 
They turn their eyes to the horizon of seas, 
And their feet seek each other and their close hands 
Now languish with softness, now quiver with gall.

Some, their hearts captivated by slow secrets 
In the depths of bushes chattering with streams, 
Go gathering the first loves of timid childhoods 
Exploring the green wood of tender trees;

Others, like nuns, slow and grave, move 
Over rocks swarming with visions, 
Where St. Anthony saw rise up the lava 
Of the purple naked breasts of his temptations;

There are some who, to the resin's shaking glimmer, 
Call, from the silent hollows of old pagan caverns, 
To you, O Bacchus, who soothe remorse, 
For help out of their shouting fevers.

And others, whose bosoms crave the scapular, 
Who hide a whip under their long clothes 
And mingle, in the dismal wood and lonely night, 
The foam of pleasure with the twists of pain.

To you, virgins, demons, monsters, martyrs,
To your great spirits spurning reality,
Searchers of the infinite, devotees and satyrs,
Now full of cries, now full of tears,

To you whom to your hell my soul has followed
My poor sisters, I give you my love and pity,
For your dark sorrows, your unslakeable thirsts,
And the caskets of your love of which your hearts are full!
