The Giantess

In those times when Nature in powerful zest 
Conceived each day monstrous children, 
I would have loved to live near a young giantess, 
A voluptuous cat at the feet of a queen.

I would have loved to see her body flower with her soul, 
To grow up freely in her prodigious play; 
To find if her heart bred some dark flame 
Amongst the humid mists swimming in her eyes;

To run leisurely over her marvelous lines;
To creep along the slopes of her enormous knees,
And sometimes in summer, when impure suns

Made her wearily stretch out across the countryside, 
To sleep carelessly in the shadow of her breasts, 
Like a peaceful village at the foot of a mountain.
