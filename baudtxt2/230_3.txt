Dream of a Curious Person

To F.N.

Have you known such a savoury grief as I? 
Do people say "Strange fellow!," whom you meet?
-- My amorous soul, when I was due to die, 
Felt longing mixed with horror; pain seemed sweet.

Anguish and ardent hope (no factious whim) 
Were mixed: and as the sands of life ran low 
My torture grew delicious yet more grim, 
And of this dear old world would not let go.

I seemed a child, so keen to see the Show 
He feels a deadly hatred of the Curtain...
And then I saw the hard, cold truth for certain.

I felt that dreadful dawn around me grow 
With no surprise or vestige of a thrill. 
The curtain rose -- and I stayed waiting still.
