Previous Existence

For a long time I lived under vast colonnades, 
Stained with a thousand fires by ocean suns, 
Whose vast pillars, straight and majestic, 
Made them seem in the evening like grottos of basalt.

The sea-swells, in swaying the pictures of the skies, 
Mingled solemnly and mystically 
The all-powerful harmonies of their rich music 
With the colors of the setting sun reflected by my eyes.

It is there that I have lived in calm voluptuousness,
In the center of the blue, amidst the waves and splendors
And the nude slaves, heavy with perfumes,

Who refreshed my forehead with palm-leaves, 
Their only care was to fathom 
The dolorous secret that made me languish.
