The Owls

'Neath their black yews in solemn state 
The owls are sitting in a row 
Like foreign gods; and even so 
Blink their red eyes; they meditate. 

Quite motionless they hold them thus 
Until at last the day is done, 
And, driving down the slanting sun, 
The sad night is victorious. 

They teach the wise who gives them ear 
That in this world he most should fear 
All things which loud or restless be. 

Who, dazzled by a passing shade, 
Follows it, never will be free 
Till the dread penalty be paid.
