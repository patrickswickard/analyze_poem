<i>Neighbouring on the City, I Recall </i>

Neighbouring on the city, I recall 
Our snow-white house, so full of peace and small: 
The casts of Venus and Pomona too 
Whose limbs a tiny thicket hid from view. 
The sun at eve, cascading fire and gold, 
Behind the glass, his sheaf of rays unrolled, 
Then, like an eye, inquisitively seemed 
To watch our long, hushed dinners as we dreamed;
Like candle-flames his glories, as they poured, 
Lit our serge curtains and our simple board.
