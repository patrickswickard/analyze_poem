The Giantess

Of old when Nature, in her verve defiant, 
Conceived each day some birth of monstrous mien,
I would have lived near some young female giant 
Like a voluptuous cat beside a queen;

To see her body flowering with her soul 
Freely develop in her mighty games, 
And in the mists that through her gaze would roll 
Guess that her heart was hatching sombre flames;

To roam her mighty contours as I please, 
Ramp on the cliff of her tremendous knees, 
And in the solstice, when the suns that kill

Make her stretch out across the land and rest, 
To sleep beneath the shadow of her breast 
Like a hushed village underneath a hill.
