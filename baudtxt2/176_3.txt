The Author's Pipe

I am an author's pipe. To see me 
And my outlandish shape to heed, 
You'd know my master was a dreamy 
Inveterate smoker of the weed.

When be is loaded down with care, 
I like a stove will smoke and burn
Wherein the supper they prepare 
Against the labourer's return.

I nurse his spirit with my charm 
Swaying it in a soft, uncertain, 
And vaguely-moving azure curtain.

I roll a potent cloud of balm 
To lull his spirit into rest 
And cure the sorrows in his breast.
