The Ghost

Like angels fierce and tawny-eyed, 
Back to your chamber I will glide, 
And noiselessly into your sight 
Steal with the shadows of the night.

And I will bring you, brown delight,
Kisses as cold as lunar night
And the caresses of a snake
Revolving in a grave. At break

Of morning in its livid hue, 
You'd find I had bequeathed to you 
An empty place as cold as stone.

Others by tenderness and ruth 
Would reign over your life and youth, 
But I would rule by fear alone.
