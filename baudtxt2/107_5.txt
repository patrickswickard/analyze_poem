The Mercenary Muse

Muse of my heart, so fond of palaces, reply: 
When January sends those blizzards wild and white, 
Shall you have any fire at all to huddle by, 
Chafing your violet feet in the black snowy night?

Think: when the moon shines through the window, shall you try 
To thaw your marble shoulders in her square of light? 
Think: when your purse is empty and your palate dry, 
Can you from the starred heaven snatch all the gold in sight?

No, no; if you would earn your bread, you have no choice 
But to become a choir-boy, and chant in a loud voice 
Te Deums you have no faith in, and swing your censer high;

Or be a mountebank, employing all your art -- 
Yes, on an empty stomach and with an anguished heart -- 
To chase the boredom of the liverish gallery.
