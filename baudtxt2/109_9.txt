The Enemy

Naught but a long blind tempest was my youth, 
Sun-shot at times; the thunder and the rain 
Have worked their havock with so little ruth 
That in my garden few red fruits remain. 

Now have I reached the autumn of my thought, 
And shovel and pick must use some soil to save 
From out the ruins that the rain hath wrought 
Where all around great pits gape like the grave. 

Who knows if these last flowers of my dreams 
Shall find beneath this naked strand that streams 
The mystic substance which their strength imparts? 

O misery! misery! Time eats our lives, 
And that dark Enemy who gnaws our hearts 
Grows by the blood he sucks from us, and thrives.
