Annihilation

Poor weary soul! To think how thou wouldst plunge and leap 
When the bright spur of Hope into thy flank was pressed!
He has unsaddled thee for good. Lie down and rest, 
Old spavined horse, old nag not worthy of thy keep.

Thou, too, my heart, lie down and sleep thy bestial sleep.

And thou, my mind, old highwayman, thou who didst fling 
Thyself from ambush upon every joy, go thou 
And skulk in peace. No pleasure will come near thee now; 
No joy can tempt so somber and uncouth a thing.

Gone, gone: even that infallible sweet thrill of spring!

Time blots me out, as flakes on freezing bodies fall; 
I see the whole round world, with every animal, 
And every flower, and every leaf on every branch, 
And there is absolutely nothing I like at all.

Come down and carry me away, O avalanche.
