To One Who Is Too Gay

Your head, your bearing, your gestures 
Are fair as a fair countryside; 
Laughter plays on your face 
Like a cool wind in a clear sky.

The gloomy passer-by you meet 
Is dazzled by the glow of health 
Which radiates resplendently 
From your arms and shoulders.

The touches of sonorous color 
That you scatter on your dresses 
Cast into the minds of poets 
The image of a flower dance.

Those crazy frocks are the emblem
Of your multi-colored nature;
Mad woman whom I'm mad about,
I hate and love you equally!

At times in a lovely garden 
Where I dragged my atony, 
I have felt the sun tear my breast, 
As though it were in mockery;

Both the springtime and its verdure 
So mortified my heart 
That I punished a flower 
For the insolence of Nature.

Thus I should like, some night,
When the hour for pleasure sounds,
To creep softly, like a coward,
Toward the treasures of your body,

To whip your joyous flesh
And bruise your pardoned breast,
To make in your astonished flank
A wide and gaping wound,

And, intoxicating sweetness!
Through those new lips,
More bright, more beautiful,
To infuse my venom, my sister!
