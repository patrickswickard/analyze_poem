The Invitation to the Voyage

How sweet, my own, 
Could we live alone 
Over beyond the sea! 
To love and to die 
Indolently 
In the land that's akin to thee! 
Where the suns which rise 
In the watery skies 
Weave soft spells over my sight, 
As thy false eyes do 
When they flicker through 
Their tears with a dim, strange light. 

There all is beauty and symmetry, 
Pleasure and calm and luxury. 

Years that have gone 
Have polished and shone 
The things that would fill our room; 
The flowers most rare 
Which scent the air 
In the richly-ceiling'd gloom, 
And the mirrors profound, 
And the walls around 
With Orient splendour hung, 
To the soul would speak 
Of things she doth seek 
In her gentle native tongue. 

There all is beauty and symmetry, 
Pleasure and calm and luxury. 

The canals are deep 
Where the strange ships sleep 
Far from the land of their birth; 
To quench the fire 
Of thy least desire 
They have come from the ends of the earth. 
The sunsets drown 
Peaceful town 
And meadow, and stagnant stream 
In bistre and gold, 
And the world enfold 
In a warm and luminous dream. 

There all is beauty and symmetry, 
Pleasure and calm and luxury.
