The Ghost

Like angels that have monster eyes, 
Over your bedside I shall rise, 
Gliding towards you silently 
Across night's black immensity.
O darksome beauty, you shall swoon 
At kisses colder than the moon 
And fondlings like a snake's who coils 
Sinuous round the grave he soils.

When livid morning breaks apace, 
You shall find but an empty place, 
Cold until night, and bleak, and drear: 
As others do by tenderness, 
So would I rule your youthfulness 
By harsh immensities of fear.
