Sed non Satiata

Strange goddess, brown as evening to the sight, 
Whose scent is half of musk, half of havanah, 
Work of some obi, Faust of the Savanah, 
Ebony witch, and daughter of the night.

By far preferred to troth, or drugs, or sleep, 
Love vaunts the red elixir of your mouth. 
My caravan of longings seeks in drouth 
Your eyes, the wells at which my cares drink deep.

Through those black eyes, by which your soul respires, 
Pitiless demon! pour less scorching fires. 
I am no Styx nine times with flame to wed.

Nor can I turn myself to Proserpine 
To break your spell, Megera libertine! 
Within the dark inferno of your bed.
