De Profundis Clamavi

O my sole love, I pray thee pity me 
From out this dark gulf where my poor heart lies 
A barren world hemmed in by leaden skies 
Where horror flies at night, and blasphemy. 

For half the year the sickly sun is seen, 
The other half thick night lies on the land, 
A country bleaker than the polar strand; 
No beasts, no brooks, nor any shred of green. 

There never was a horror which surpassed 
This icy sun's cold cruelty, and this vast 
Night like primaeval Chaos; would I were 

Like the dumb brutes, who in a secret lair 
Lie wrapt in stupid slumber for a space...
The time creeps at so burdensome a pace.
