Allegory

She is a woman of appearance fine 
Who lets her tresses trail into her wine. 
Love's claws and poisons, brewed in sinks of sin, 
Fall blunted from the granite of her skin. 
She mocks Debauchery, Death leaves her blithe, 
Two monsters always handy with the scythe. 
In their grim games, where so much beauty's wrecked, 
They treat her majesty with due respect. 
Half goddess, half sultana, without scathe, 
In pleasure she's a Moslem's steady faith. 
Between her open arms, filled by her breasts, 
For all mankind with burning eyes she quests, 
And she believes, this fruitless virgin-wife, 
Who's yet so necessary to this life, 
That beauty of the body is a gift 
Sublime enough all infamy to shift, 
And win forgiveness. She knows naught of Hell. 
When the Night comes, in which she is to dwell, 
Straight in the face she'll look her deadly Fate, 
Like one new-born -- without remorse or hate.
