Owls

Under the dark yews which shade them, 
The owls are perched in rows, 
Like so many strange gods, 
Darting their red eyes. They meditate.

Without budging they will remain 
Till that melancholy hour 
When, pushing back the slanting sun, 
Darkness will take up its abode.

Their attitude teaches the wise 
That in this world one must fear 
Movement and commotion;

Man, enraptured by a passing shadow, 
Forever bears the punishment 
Of having tried to change his place.
