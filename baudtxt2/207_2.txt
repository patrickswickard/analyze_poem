Ever the Same

"Whence comes to you, you asked, this singular sadness
That rises like the sea on the naked, black rock?"
-- Once our heart has gathered the grapes from its vineyard,
Living is an evil. That's a secret known to all,

A simple pain, with no mystery, 
As obvious to all men as your gaiety. 
So abandon your search, inquisitive beauty; 
And though your voice is sweet, be still!

Be silent, ignorant! ever enraptured soul! 
Mouth with the child-like laugh! Still more than Life, 
Death holds us frequently with subtle bonds.

Let, let my heart become drunk with a <i>lie;</i> let it 
Plunge into your fair eyes as into a fair dream 
And slumber long in the shadow of your lashes.
