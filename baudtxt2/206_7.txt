A Ghost

I Perfume

Reader, have you ever breathed in
With intoxication and slow gluttony, 
That grain of incense which fills a church, 
Or that embedded musk of a scent-bag?

Deep, magical charm, the past recalled 
By you now makes us drunk. 
Thus a lover plucks from an adored body 
The exquisite flower of memory.

From her buoyant, heavy hair,
A living sachet, censer of recesses,
There climbs a fragrance, savage, wild,

And from her muslin or velvet dresses, 
Permeated with her pure youth, 
Escapes a perfume of fur.

II The Frame

As a fine frame adds to its picture, 
Though it may come from a well-known brush, 
Thus jewels, furniture, metals or gilding 
Adapted themselves quite to her unusual beauty;

it was some strange enchantment, 
Parting her from enormous nature; 
Nothing darkened her perfect pellucidity, 
Everything seemed to serve her as frame.

At times one would even have said that she thought
That all things desired to love her; voluptuously
She drowned her nakedness

In kisses of satin and linen, 
And, slow or sudden, in each movement 
Showed the childlike grace of the monkey.
