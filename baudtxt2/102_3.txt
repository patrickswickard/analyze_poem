Elevation

Above the valleys and the lakes: beyond
The woods, seas, clouds and mountain-ranges: far
Above the sun, the aethers silver-swanned
With nebulae, and the remotest star,

My spirit! with agility you move 
Like a strong swimmer with the seas to fight, 
Through the blue vastness furrowing your groove
With an ineffable and male delight.

Far from these foetid marshes, be made pure
In the pure air of the superior sky, 
And drink, like some most exquisite liqueur, 
The fire that fills the lucid realms on high.

Beyond where cares or boredom hold dominion, 
Which charge our fogged existence with their spleen, 
Happy is he who with a stalwart pinion 
Can seek those fields so shining and serene:

Whose thoughts, like larks, rise on the freshening breeze 
Who fans the morning with his tameless wings, 
Skims over life, and understands with ease 
The speech of flowers and other voiceless things.
