Metamorphoses of a Vampire

Meanwhile the woman, writhing like a snake 
On fiery coals, kneaded her breasts to make 
Them hug their steely corset; and she said, 
Her lips redder than strawberries are red:

&quot;Behold, my mouth is moist, and on my deep
Couch I can lull grim Conscience fast asleep,
I dry all tears on my triumphant breasts,
Where old men laugh like boys at boyish jests.
For him who sees me naked, I comprise
All moons and suns and stars and clouds and skies!
I am so skilled, fond scholar, in love's charms
That when I hug you in my ruthless arms,
Or, shy and lustful, frail and forceful, when
I yield taut nipples to the teeth of men,
My bosom's pillows, palpitant, would doom
Angels to ruin for coveting my womb...&quot;

When she had sucked my marrow dry, I turned,
Languid, to give her back the kiss she earned,
Only to view, I fond and amorous,
A viscid wineskin, nidorous with pus...

Frozen with fear, I shut my eyelids tight, 
Then, opening them against the garish light, 
I saw no solid puppet by my side 
Whose lusts my blood, drained dry, had satisfied, 
But a debris of quavering bone on bone, 
Moaning as only weathervanes can moan, 
And creaking as a rusty signpost might 
Lashed by the furies of a winter night.
