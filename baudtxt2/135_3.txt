All, All

The Devil up my attic stair
Came tiptoeing a while ago
And, trying to catch me unaware,
Said laughing, "I should like to know,

"Of all her many charms, what springs
Most often to your mind? Of all
The rose-colored and shadowy things
Whereby her beauty may enthrall,

"Which is the sweetest?" -- O my soul, 
You answered the abhorred Guest: 
"Her beauty is complete and whole. 
No single part is loveliest.

"When she is near, I cannot say 
What gives me such intense delight. 
She dazzles like the break of day, 
She comforts like the fall of night.

"My senses seem to merge in one; 
The harmony that rules her being 
Is all my knowledge -- I have none 
Of hearing, smelling, touching, seeing.

"No, no. I cannot make a choice
In this sublime bewilderment.
Perhaps the music of her scent!
Perhaps the perfume of her voice!"
