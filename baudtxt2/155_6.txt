The Cats

The lover and the stern philosopher 
Both love, in their ripe time, the confident 
Soft cats, the house's chiefest ornament, 
Who like themselves are cold and seldom stir. 

Of knowledge and of pleasure amorous, 
Silence they seek and Darkness' fell domain; 
Had not their proud souls scorned to brook his rein, 
They would have made grim steeds for Erebus. 

Pensive they rest in noble attitudes 
Like great stretched sphinxes in vast solitudes 
Which seem to sleep wrapt in an endless dream; 

Their fruitful loins are full of sparks divine, 
And gleams of gold within their pupils shine 
As 'twere within the shadow of a stream.
