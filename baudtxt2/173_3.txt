The Burial of an Accursed Poet

If on a night obscure and deep, 
Some decent Christian, out of ruth, 
Buries behind some garbage-heap 
The vaunted body of your youth:

There, when the chaster stars have set 
And the moon her hammock slung 
Will the spider weave his net 
And the adder batch her young.

Your curse'd head beneath the ground
Will hear, through all the seasons then,
The dismal cries of wolves resound,

Old half-starved witches raising spooks, 
The antics of obscene old men, 
And black conspiracies of crooks.
