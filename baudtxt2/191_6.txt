Les Litanies de Satan

wisest and fairest of the Angels young,
o god whom fate betrayed and left unsung,

Satan, have pity on my long despair!

o exiled Prince borne down by many lies,
who, conquered, ever mightier dost arise,

Satan, have pity on my long despair!

o thou who knowest all things, who dost reign
in nether worlds, who healest all men's pain,

Satan, have pity on my long despair!

thou who to pariahs and lepers dost
reveal, through love, the heaven they have lost,

Satan, have pity on my long despair!

thou who with Death, that old and mighty trull,
begot us Hope, so mad, so beautiful!

Satan, have pity on my long despair!

o thou who gives bandits, doomed to die,
the brows which damn a nation, standing nigh,

Satan, have pity on my long despair!

o though who knowest in what crabbed zones
of earth, God locked away the precious stones,

Satan, have pity on my long despair!

o thou who seest through the deep dark walls
where sleep the metals' buried arsenals,

Satan, have pity on my long despair!

o thou whose hands upon the housetop keep
the abysses veiled from those who walk in sleep,

Satan, have pity on my long despair!

o thou who savest from the horses' feet
the poor old drunkard fallen in the street,

Satan, have pity on my long despair!

o thou who showest suffering mortals how
to mix the salts and sulphur -- blessed thou

Satan, have pity on my long despair!

thou who dost brand in subtle friendliness
the brows of rich men base and merciless,

Satan, have pity on my long despair!

o thou who hussies' eyes and bosoms chill
with lust of blood and love of rags dost fill,

Satan, have pity on my long despair!

staff of the exiled, torch inventors woo,
confessor of the gallows' plotting crew,

Satan, have pity on my long despair!

o foster-father of us all, who share
God's primal curse, and lost our Eden there,

Satan, have pity on my long despair!

glory and praise to the, in heaven above
where thou didst reign, and in the abysses of
thy Hell, where thou art brooding, silently!
grant that with thee my soul, beneath the Tree
of Knowledge may find rest, when, o'er thy brows, 
like a new Temple it puts forth its boughs!
