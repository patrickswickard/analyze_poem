Confession

Once, and once only, kind and gentle lady, 
Your polished arm on mine you placed 
(Deep down within my spirit, dark and shady, 
I keep the memory uneffaced).

A medal, newly-coined, of flashing silver, 
The full moon shone. The night was old. 
Its solemn grandeur, like a mighty river, 
Through sleeping Paris softly rolled.

Along the streets, by courtyard doors, cats darted 
And passed in furtive, noiseless flight 
With cars pricked; or, like shades of friends departed, 
Followed us slowly through the night.

Cutting this easy intimacy through, 
That hatched from out that pearly light --  
O rich resounding instrument, from you, 
Who'd always thrilled with loud delight,

From you, till then as joyful as a peal 
Of trumpets on a sparkling morn, 
A cry so plaintive that it seemed unreal, 
Was staggeringly torn.

Like some misborn, deformed, and monstrous kid 
Who puts his family to the blush, 
Whose presence in a cellar must be hid 
And his existence in a hush!

Poor angel! that harsh note was meant to sing 
"That nothing in this world is certain, 
And human egotism is the thing 
Which all existence serves to curtain.

That it's an irksome task to be a beauty, 
A boring job one has to face -- 
Like frigid dancers, smiling as a duty 
With hard, mechanical grimace:

That building upon hearts is idiotic: 
All cracks, love, beauty, and fraternity 
Until Oblivion puts them in his pocket 
To pawn them on to old Eternity!"

I often have recalled that moon of magic, 
That languid hush on quays and marts, 
And then this confidence, so grim and tragic, 
In the confessional of hearts.
