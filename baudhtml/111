<b>La Vie ant&eacute;rieure</b><br>
</p>

<p>
J'ai longtemps habit&eacute; sous de vastes portiques<br>
Que les soleils marins teignaient de mille feux,<br>
Et que leurs grands piliers, droits et majestueux,<br>
Rendaient pareils, le soir, aux grottes basaltiques.<br>
</p>

<p>
Les houles, en roulant les images des cieux,<br>
M&ecirc;laient d'une fa&ccedil;on solennelle et mystique<br>
Les tout-puissants accords de leur riche musique<br>
Aux couleurs du couchant refl&eacute;t&eacute; par mes yeux.<br>
</p>

<p>
C'est l&agrave; que j'ai v&eacute;cu dans les volupt&eacute;s calmes,<br>
Au milieu de l'azur, des vagues, des splendeurs<br>
Et des esclaves nus, tout impr&eacute;gn&eacute;s d'odeurs,<br>
</p>

<p>
Qui me rafra&icirc;chissaient le front avec des palmes,<br>
Et dont l'unique soin &eacute;tait d'approfondir<br>
Le secret douloureux qui me faisait languir.<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>My Former Life</b><br>
</p>

<p>
For a long time I dwelt under vast porticos <br>
Which the ocean suns lit with a thousand colors, <br>
The pillars of which, tall, straight, and majestic, <br>
Made them, in the evening, like basaltic grottos.<br>
</p>

<p>
The billows which cradled the image of the sky <br>
Mingled, in a solemn, mystical way, <br>
The omnipotent chords of their rich harmonies <br>
With the sunsets' colors reflected in my eyes;<br>
</p>

<p>
It was there that I lived in voluptuous calm,<br>
In splendor, between the azure and the sea,<br>
And I was attended by slaves, naked, perfumed,<br>
</p>

<p>
Who fanned my brow with fronds of palms <br>
And whose sole task it was to fathom <br>
The dolorous secret that made me pine away.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Former Life</b>
</p>

<p>
I've lived beneath huge portals where marine <br>
Suns coloured, with a myriad fires, the waves; <br>
At eve majestic pillars made the scene <br>
Resemble those of vast basaltic caves.<br>
</p>

<p>
The breakers, rolling the reflected skies, <br>
Mixed, in a solemn, enigmatic way, <br>
The powerful symphonies they seem to play <br>
With colours of the sunset in my eyes.<br>
</p>

<p>
There did I live in a voluptuous calm<br>
Where breezes, waves, and splendours roved as vagrants; <br>
And naked slaves, impregnated with fragrance,<br>
</p>

<p>
Would fan my forehead with their fronds of palm: <br>
Their only charge was to increase the anguish <br>
Of secret grief in which I loved to languish.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>


<p>
<b>My Former Life</b><br>
</p>

<p>
I can remember a country of long, high colonnades <br>
Which mirrored in their pale marble the prismatic light <br>
Cast from the bright sea billows in a thousand shades, <br>
And which resembled a cave of fluted basalt by night.<br>
</p>

<p>
The ocean, strewn with sliding images of the sky, <br>
Would mingle in a mysterious and solemn way, <br>
Under the wild brief sunsets, its tremendous cry <br>
With the reflected colors of the ruined day.<br>
</p>

<p>
There did I dwell in quiet luxury apart,<br>
Amid the slowly changing hues of clouds and waves; <br>
And there I was attended by two naked slaves<br>
</p>

<p>
Who sometimes fanned me with great fronds on either side, <br>
And whose sole task was to let sink into my heart <br>
The dolorous and beautiful secret of which I died.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; George Dillon, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>La Vie ant&eacute;rieure</b><br>
</p>

<p>
aeons I dwelt beneath vast porticoes<br>
stained by the sun and sea with fiery dye,<br>
whose lordly pillars, stark against the sky,<br>
like caverned cliffs in evening's gold arose.<br>
</p>

<p>
the rolling surges and their mirror skies<br>
blent in a grave mysterious organ-air<br>
the chords all-powerful of their music rare<br>
with sunset's colours in my glowing eyes.<br>
</p>

<p>
'twas there I lived before, 'mid azure waves,<br>
blue skies and splendours, in voluptuous calm,<br>
while, steeped in every fragrance, naked slaves<br>
</p>

<p>
made cool my brow with waving fronds of palm:<br>
&mdash; their only care to drive the secret dart<br>
of my dull sorrow, deeper in my heart.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Lewis Piaget Shanks, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (New York: Ives Washburn, 1931)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>A Former Life</b>
</p>

<p>
Long since, I lived beneath vast porticoes,<br>
By many ocean-sunsets tinged and fired,<br>
Where mighty pillars, in majestic rows,<br>
Seemed like basaltic caves when day expired.<br>
</p>

<p>
The rolling surge that mirrored all the skies<br>
Mingled its music, turbulent and rich,<br>
Solemn and mystic, with the colours which<br>
The setting sun reflected in my eyes.<br>
</p>

<p>
And there I lived amid voluptuous calms,<br>
In splendours of blue sky and wandering wave,<br>
Tended by many a naked, perfumed slave,<br>
</p>

<p>
Who fanned my languid brow with waving palms.<br>
They were my slaves &mdash; the only care they had<br>
To know what secret grief had made me sad.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; F.P. Sturm, from <i>Baudelaire: His Prose and Poetry</i>, edited by Thomas Robert Smith (New York: Boni and Liveright, 1919)
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Previous Existence</b><br>
</p>

<p>
For a long time I lived under vast colonnades, <br>
Stained with a thousand fires by ocean suns, <br>
Whose vast pillars, straight and majestic, <br>
Made them seem in the evening like grottos of basalt.<br>
</p>

<p>
The sea-swells, in swaying the pictures of the skies, <br>
Mingled solemnly and mystically <br>
The all-powerful harmonies of their rich music <br>
With the colors of the setting sun reflected by my eyes.<br>
</p>

<p>
It is there that I have lived in calm voluptuousness,<br>
In the center of the blue, amidst the waves and splendors<br>
And the nude slaves, heavy with perfumes,<br>
</p>

<p>
Who refreshed my forehead with palm-leaves, <br>
Their only care was to fathom <br>
The dolorous secret that made me languish.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Geoffrey Wagner, <i>Selected Poems of Charles Baudelaire</i> (NY: Grove Press, 1974) <br>
