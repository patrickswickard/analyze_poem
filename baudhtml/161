<b>Spleen</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Quand le ciel bas et lourd p&egrave;se comme un couvercle<br>
Sur l'esprit g&eacute;missant en proie aux longs ennuis,<br>
Et que de l'horizon embrassant tout le cercle<br>
II nous verse un jour noir plus triste que les nuits;<br>
</p>

<p>
Quand la terre est chang&eacute;e en un cachot humide,<br>
O&ugrave; l'Esp&eacute;rance, comme une chauve-souris,<br>
S'en va battant les murs de son aile timide<br>
Et se cognant la t&ecirc;te &agrave; des plafonds pourris;<br>
</p>

<p>
Quand la pluie &eacute;talant ses immenses tra&icirc;n&eacute;es<br>
D'une vaste prison imite les barreaux,<br>
Et qu'un peuple muet d'inf&acirc;mes araign&eacute;es<br>
Vient tendre ses filets au fond de nos cerveaux,<br>
</p>

<p>
Des cloches tout &agrave; coup sautent avec furie<br>
Et lancent vers le ciel un affreux hurlement,<br>
Ainsi que des esprits errants et sans patrie<br>
Qui se mettent &agrave; geindre opini&acirc;trement.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Et de longs corbillards, sans tambours ni musique,<br>
D&eacute;filent lentement dans mon &acirc;me; l'Espoir,<br>
Vaincu, pleure, et l'Angoisse atroce, despotique,<br>
Sur mon cr&acirc;ne inclin&eacute; plante son drapeau noir.<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>Spleen</b><br>
</p>

<p>
When the low, heavy sky weighs like a lid <br>
On the groaning spirit, victim of long ennui, <br>
And from the all-encircling horizon <br>
Spreads over us a day gloomier than the night;<br>
</p>

<p>
When the earth is changed into a humid dungeon, <br>
In which Hope like a bat <br>
Goes beating the walls with her timid wings <br>
And knocking her head against the rotten ceiling;<br>
</p>

<p>
When the rain stretching out its endless train<br>
Imitates the bars of a vast prison<br>
And a silent horde of loathsome spiders<br>
Comes to spin their webs in the depths of our brains,<br>
</p>

<p>
All at once the bells leap with rage <br>
And hurl a frightful roar at heaven, <br>
Even as wandering spirits with no country <br>
Burst into a stubborn, whimpering cry.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; And without drums or music, long hearses <br>
Pass by slowly in my soul; Hope, vanquished, <br>
Weeps, and atrocious, despotic Anguish <br>
On my bowed skull plants her black flag.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>

<p>
<b>Spleen</b>
</p>

<p>
When the cold heavy sky weighs like a lid <br>
On spirits whom eternal boredom grips, <br>
And the wide ring of the horizon's hid <br>
In daytime darker than the night's eclipse:<br>
</p>

<p>
When the world seems a dungeon, damp and small, <br>
Where hope flies like a bat, in circles reeling, <br>
Beating his timid wings against the wall <br>
And dashing out his brains against the ceiling:<br>
</p>

<p>
When trawling rains have made their steel-grey fibres <br>
Look like the grilles of some tremendous jail, <br>
And a whole nation of disgusting spiders <br>
Over our brains their dusty cobwebs trail:<br>
</p>

<p>
Suddenly bells are fiercely clanged about<br>
And hurl a fearsome howl into the sky<br>
Like spirits from their country hunted out<br>
Who've nothing else to do but shriek and cry &mdash; <br>
</p>

<p>
Then long processions without fifes or drums <br>
Wind slowly through my soul. Hope, weeping, bows <br>
To conquest. And atrocious Anguish comes <br>
To plant his black flag on my drooping brows.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>

<p>
<b>When the Low, Heavy Sky</b><br>
</p>

<p>
When the low, heavy sky weighs like the giant lid <br>
Of a great pot upon the spirit crushed by care, <br>
And from the whole horizon encircling us is shed <br>
A day blacker than night, and thicker with despair;<br>
</p>

<p>
When Earth becomes a dungeon, where the timid bat <br>
Called Confidence, against the damp and slippery walls <br>
Goes beating his blind wings, goes feebly bumping at <br>
The rotted, moldy ceiling, and the plaster falls;<br>
</p>

<p>
When, dark and dropping straight, the long lines of the rain <br>
Like prison-bars outside the window cage us in; <br>
And silently, about the caught and helpless brain, <br>
We feel the spider walk, and test the web, and spin;<br>
</p>

<p>
Then all the bells at once ring out in furious clang, <br>
Bombarding heaven with howling, horrible to hear, <br>
Like lost and wandering souls, that whine in shrill harangue <br>
Their obstinate complaints to an unlistening ear.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; And a long line of hearses, with neither dirge nor drums, <br>
Begins to cross my soul. Weeping, with steps that lag, <br>
Hope walks in chains; and Anguish, after long wars, becomes <br>
Tyrant at last, and plants on me his inky flag.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Edna St. Vincent Millay, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Spleen</b><br>
</p>

<p>
when low skies weightier than a coffin-lid<br>
cast on the moaning soul their weary blight,<br>
and from the whole horizon's murky grid<br>
its grey light drips more dismal than the night;<br>
</p>

<p>
when earth's a dungeon damp whose chill appals,<br>
in which &mdash; a fluttering bat &mdash; my Hope, alone<br>
buffets with timid wing the mouldering walls<br>
and beats her head against the dome of stone;<br>
</p>

<p>
when close as prison-bars, from overhead,<br>
the clouds let fall the curtain of the rains,<br>
and voiceless hordes of spiders come, to spread<br>
their infamous cobwebs through our darkened brains,<br>
</p>

<p>
explosively the bells begin to ring,<br>
hurling their frightful clangour toward the sky,<br>
as homeless spirits lost and wandering<br>
might raise their indefatigable cry;<br>
</p>

<p>
and ancient hearses through my soul advance<br>
muffled and slow; my Hope, now pitiful,<br>
weeps her defeat, and conquering Anguish plants<br>
his great black banner on my cowering skull.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Lewis Piaget Shanks, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (New York: Ives Washburn, 1931)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Spleen</b><br>
</p>

<p>
When the low heavy sky weighs like a lid <br>
Upon the spirit aching for the light, <br>
And all the wide horizon's line is hid <br>
By a black day sadder than any night; <br>
</p>

<p>
When the changed earth is but a dungeon dank <br>
Where batlike Hope goes blindly fluttering <br>
And, striking wall and roof and mouldered plank, <br>
Bruises his tender head and timid wing; <br>
</p>

<p>
When like grim prison-bars stretch down the thin, <br>
Straight, rigid pillars of the endless rain, <br>
And the dumb throngs of infamous spiders spin <br>
Their meshes in the caverns of the brain; &mdash; <br>
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, bells leap forth into the air, <br>
Hurling a hideous uproar to the sky <br>
As 'twere a band of homeless spirits who fare <br>
Through the strange heavens, wailing stubbornly. <br>
</p>

<p>
And hearses, without drum or instrument, <br>
File slowly through my soul; crushed, sorrowful, <br>
Weeps Hope, and Grief, fierce and omnipotent, <br>
Plants his black banner on my drooping skull. <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jack Collings Squire, <i>Poems and Baudelaire Flowers</i> (London: The New Age Press, Ltd, 1909)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Spleen</b><br>
</p>

<p>
When the low and heavy sky presses like a lid <br>
On the groaning heart a prey to slow cares, <br>
And when from a horizon holding the whole orb <br>
There is cast at us a dark sky more sad than night;<br>
</p>

<p>
When earth is changed to a damp dungeon, <br>
Where Hope, like a bat, <br>
Flees beating the walls with its timorous wings, <br>
And knocking its head on the rotting ceilings;<br>
</p>

<p>
When the rain spreads out vast trails<br>
Like the bars of a huge prison,<br>
And when, like sordid spiders, silent people stretch<br>
Threads to the depths of our brains,<br>
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the bells jump furiously <br>
And hurl to the sky a horrible shriek, <br>
Like some wandering landless spirits <br>
Starting an obstinate complaint.<br>
</p>

<p>
 &mdash; And long hearses, with no drums, no music, <br>
File slowly through my soul: Hope, <br>
Conquered, cries, and despotic atrocious Agony <br>
Plants on my bent skull its flag of black.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Geoffrey Wagner, <i>Selected Poems of Charles Baudelaire</i> (NY: Grove Press, 1974) <br>

Two editions of <i>Fleurs du mal</i> were published in Baudelaire's lifetime &mdash; one in 1857 and an expanded edition in 1861. "Scraps" and censored poems were collected in <i>Les &Eacute;paves</i> in 1866. After Baudelaire died the following year, a "definitive" edition appeared in 1868.
