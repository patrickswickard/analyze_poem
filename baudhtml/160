<b>Spleen</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Je suis comme le roi d'un pays pluvieux,<br>
Riche, mais impuissant, jeune et pourtant tr&egrave;s vieux,<br>
Qui, de ses pr&eacute;cepteurs m&eacute;prisant les courbettes,<br>
S'ennuie avec ses chiens comme avec d'autres b&ecirc;tes.<br>
Rien ne peut l'&eacute;gayer, ni gibier, ni faucon,<br>
Ni son peuple mourant en face du balcon.<br>
Du bouffon favori la grotesque ballade<br>
Ne distrait plus le front de ce cruel malade;<br>
Son lit fleurdelis&eacute; se transforme en tombeau,<br>
Et les dames d'atour, pour qui tout prince est beau,<br>
Ne savent plus trouver d'impudique toilette<br>
Pour tirer un souris de ce jeune squelette.<br>
Le savant qui lui fait de l'or n'a jamais pu<br>
De son &ecirc;tre extirper l'&eacute;l&eacute;ment corrompu,<br>
Et dans ces bains de sang qui des Romains nous viennent,<br>
Et dont sur leurs vieux jours les puissants se souviennent,<br>
II n'a su r&eacute;chauffer ce cadavre h&eacute;b&eacute;t&eacute;<br>
O&ugrave; coule au lieu de sang l'eau verte du L&eacute;th&eacute; <br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>Spleen</b><br>
</p>

<p>
I am like the king of a rainy land, <br>
Wealthy but powerless, both young and very old, <br>
Who contemns the fawning manners of his tutors <br>
And is bored with his dogs and other animals. <br>
Nothing can cheer him, neither the chase nor falcons, <br>
Nor his people dying before his balcony. <br>
The ludicrous ballads of his favorite clown <br>
No longer smooth the brow of this cruel invalid; <br>
His bed, adorned with fleurs-de-lis, becomes a grave; <br>
The lady's maids, to whom every prince is handsome, <br>
No longer can find gowns shameless enough <br>
To wring a smile from this young skeleton. <br>
The alchemist who makes his gold was never able <br>
To extract from him the tainted element, <br>
And in those baths of blood come down from Roman times, <br>
And which in their old age the powerful recall, <br>
He failed to warm this dazed cadaver in whose veins <br>
Flows the green water of Lethe in place of blood.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>

<b>Spleen</b>
</p>

<p>
I'm like the King of some damp, rainy clime, <br>
Grown impotent and old before my time, <br>
Who scorns the bows and scrapings of his teachers <br>
And bores himself with hounds and all such creatures. <br>
Naught can amuse him, falcon, steed, or chase: <br>
No, not the mortal plight of his whole race <br>
Dying before his balcony. The tune, <br>
Sung to this tyrant by his pet buffoon, <br>
Irks him. His couch seems far more like a grave. <br>
Even the girls, for whom all kings seem brave, <br>
Can think no toilet up, nor shameless rig, <br>
To draw a smirk from this funereal prig. <br>
The sage who makes him gold, could never find <br>
The baser element that rots his mind. <br>
Even those blood-baths the old Romans knew <br>
And later thugs have imitated too, <br>
Can't warm this skeleton to deeds of slaughter, <br>
Whose only blood is Lethe's cold, green water.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>

<b>Spleen</b><br>
</p>

<p>
I'm like the king of a rain-country, rich<br>
but sterile, young but with an old wolf's itch,<br>
one who escapes his tutor's monologues,<br>
and kills the day in boredom with his dogs;<br>
nothing cheers him, darts, tennis, falconry,<br>
his people dying by the balcony;<br>
the bawdry of the pet hermaphrodite<br>
no longer gets him through a single night;<br>
his bed of fleur-de-lys becomes a tomb;<br>
even the ladies of the court, for whom<br>
all kings are beautiful, cannot put on<br>
shameful enough dresses for this skeleton;<br>
the scholar who makes his gold cannot invent<br>
washes to cleanse the poisoned element;<br>
even in baths of blood, Rome's legacy,<br>
our tyrants' solace in senility,<br>
he cannot warm up his shot corpse, whose food<br>
is syrup-green Lethean ooze, not blood.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Robert Lowell, from Marthiel &amp; Jackson Matthews, eds., <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: New Directions, 1963)<br>

<p>
<b>The King of the Rainy Country</b><br>
</p>

<p>
A rainy country this, that I am monarch of, &mdash; <br>
A rich but powerless king, worn-out while yet a boy; <br>
For whom in vain the falcon falls upon the dove; <br>
Not even his starving people's groans can give him joy; <br>
Scorning his tutors, loathing his spaniels, finding stale <br>
His favorite jester's quips, yawning at the droll tale. <br>
His bed, for all its <i>fleurs de lis,</i> looks like a tomb; <br>
The ladies of the court, attending him, to whom <br>
He, being a prince, is handsome, see him lying there <br>
Cold as a corpse, and lift their shoulders in despair: <br>
No garment they take off, no garter they leave on <br>
Excites the gloomy eye of this young skeleton. <br>
The royal alchemist, who makes him gold from lead,<br>
The baser element from out the royal head <br>
Cannot extract; nor can those Roman baths of blood, <br>
For some so efficacious, cure the hebetude <br>
Of him, along whose veins, where flows no blood at all, <br>
For ever the slow waters of green Lethe crawl.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Edna St. Vincent Millay, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>

<b>Spleen</b><br>
</p>

<p>
I'm like a king of rainy lands and cold<br>
&mdash; wealthy, but impotent: still young, but old &mdash;<br>
who, scornful of his tutors' bows, prefers<br>
his hounds and boredom to such grovellers.<br>
nor stag nor falcon rouse his apathy,<br>
nor starving subjects 'neath his balcony.<br>
his favourite jester's wildest ballads now<br>
no longer clear his cruel, sickened brow;<br>
his royal bed's a coffin drowned in care,<br>
and court-ladies, to whom all kings are fair,<br>
&mdash; seeking a smile from that young skeleton &mdash; <br>
no longer find one shameless robe to don.<br>
nor can the sage who makes him gold succeed<br>
in purging him of Death's corruptive seed,<br>
nor in the baths of blood the Romans knew,<br>
wherein the ag&egrave;d rich their strength renew,<br>
learn how to warm that cold numb corpse, through whose<br>
dull veins, for blood, green Lethe's waters ooze.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Lewis Piaget Shanks, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (New York: Ives Washburn, 1931)<br>

<b>Spleen</b>
</p>

<p>
I'm like some king in whose corrupted veins<br>
Flows ag√®d blood; who rules a land of rains;<br>
Who, young in years, is old in all distress;<br>
Who flees good counsel to find weariness<br>
Among his dogs and playthings, who is stirred<br>
Neither by hunting-hound nor hunting-bird;<br>
Whose weary face emotion moves no more<br>
E'en when his people die before his door.<br>
His favourite Jester's most fantastic wile<br>
Upon that sick, cruel face can raise no smile;<br>
The courtly dames, to whom all kings are good,<br>
Can lighten this young skeleton's dull mood<br>
No more with shameless toilets. In his gloom<br>
Even his lilied bed becomes a tomb.<br>
The sage who takes his gold essays in vain<br>
To purge away the old corrupted strain,<br>
His baths of blood, that in the days of old<br>
The Romans used when their hot blood grew cold,<br>
Will never warm this dead man's bloodless pains,<br>
For green Lethean water fills his veins.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; F.P. Sturm, from <i>Baudelaire: His Prose and Poetry</i>, edited by Thomas Robert Smith (New York: Boni and Liveright, 1919)

Two editions of <i>Fleurs du mal</i> were published in Baudelaire's lifetime &mdash; one in 1857 and an expanded edition in 1861. "Scraps" and censored poems were collected in <i>Les &Eacute;paves</i> in 1866. After Baudelaire died the following year, a "definitive" edition appeared in 1868.
