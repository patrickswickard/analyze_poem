<b>Semper eadem</b><br>
</p>

<p>
&laquo;D'o&ugrave; vous vient, disiez-vous, cette tristesse &eacute;trange,<br>
Montant comme la mer sur le roc noir et nu?&raquo;<br>
&mdash; Quand notre coeur a fait une fois sa vendange<br>
Vivre est un mal. C'est un secret de tous connu,<br>
</p>

<p>
Une douleur tr&egrave;s simple et non myst&eacute;rieuse<br>
Et, comme votre joie, &eacute;clatante pour tous.<br>
Cessez donc de chercher, &ocirc; belle curieuse!<br>
Et, bien que votre voix soit douce, taisez-vous!<br>
</p>

<p>
Taisez-vous, ignorante! &acirc;me toujours ravie!<br>
Bouche au rire enfantin! Plus encor que la Vie,<br>
La Mort nous tient souvent par des liens subtils.<br>
</p>

<p>
Laissez, laissez mon coeur s'enivrer d'un <i>mensonge,</i><br>
Plonger dans vos beaux yeux comme dans un beau songe<br>
Et sommeiller longtemps &agrave; l'ombre de vos cils!<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>Ever the Same</b><br>
</p>

<p>
"Whence comes to you, you asked, this singular sadness<br>
That rises like the sea on the naked, black rock?"<br>
&mdash; Once our heart has gathered the grapes from its vineyard,<br>
Living is an evil. That's a secret known to all,<br>
</p>

<p>
A simple pain, with no mystery, <br>
As obvious to all men as your gaiety. <br>
So abandon your search, inquisitive beauty; <br>
And though your voice is sweet, be still!<br>
</p>

<p>
Be silent, ignorant! ever enraptured soul! <br>
Mouth with the child-like laugh! Still more than Life, <br>
Death holds us frequently with subtle bonds.<br>
</p>

<p>
Let, let my heart become drunk with a <i>lie;</i> let it <br>
Plunge into your fair eyes as into a fair dream <br>
And slumber long in the shadow of your lashes.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Semper Eadem</b>
</p>

<p>
"Whence," ask you, "does this strange new sadness flow<br>
Like rising tides on rocks, black, bare, and vast?"<br>
For human hearts, when vintage-time is past,<br>
To live is bad. That secret all men know &mdash; <br>
</p>

<p>
An obvious sorrow, with no mystery, shown, <br>
Clear as your joy, to everyone around. <br>
O curious one, seek nothing more profound, <br>
And speak not, though your voice be sweet in tone.<br>
</p>

<p>
Hush, ignorant! Hush, soul that's still enraptured, <br>
And mouth of childish laughter! Neatly captured, <br>
Death pulls us, more than life, with subtle wile.<br>
</p>

<p>
Oh let my thought get drunk upon a lie, <br>
And plunge, as in a dream, in either eye, <br>
And in their lashes' shadow sleep awhile!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>


<p>
<b>Semper Eadem</b><br>
</p>

<p>
"What in the world," you said, "has brought on this black mood, <br>
Climbing you as the sea climbs up a naked reef?"<br>
&mdash; When once the heart has made its harvest (understood <br>
By all men, this) why, just to be alive is grief:<br>
</p>

<p>
A pain quite simple, nothing mysterious at all, <br>
And like that joy of yours, patent to all we meet; <br>
Stop asking questions, then, I beg of you, and fall <br>
Silent a while, fair prober, though your voice be sweet.<br>
</p>

<p>
Ah, yes, be silent, ignorant girl, always so gay, <br>
Mouth with the childlike laughter! More than Life, I say, <br>
Death has the power to hold us by most subtle ties.<br>
</p>

<p>
My one fictitious comfort, kindly, let me keep: <br>
To plunge as into dreams into your lovely eyes, <br>
And in the shadow of your lashes fall asleep.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Edna St. Vincent Millay, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Semper Eadem</b>
</p>

<p>
"From whence it comes, you ask, this gloom acute, <br>
Like waves that o'er the rocky headland fall?"<br>
When once our hearts have gathered in their fruit, <br>
To live is a curse! a secret known to all, <br>
</p>

<p>
A grief, quite simple, nought mysterious, <br>
And like your joy &mdash; for all, both loud and shrill, <br>
Nay cease to clamor, be not e'er so curious! <br>
And yet although your voice is sweet, be still! <br>
</p>

<p>
Be still, O soul, with rapture ever rife! <br>
O mouth, with the childish smile! Far more than Life, <br>
The subtle bonds of Death around us twine. <br>
</p>

<p>
Let &mdash; let my heart, the wine of falsehood drink, <br>
And dream-like, deep within your fair eyes sink, <br>
And in the shade of thy lashes long recline! <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Cyril Scott, <i>Baudelaire: The Flowers of Evil</i> (London: Elkin Mathews, 1909)
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Semper eadam</b><br>
</p>

<p>
you asked: "what floods of gloom engulf you &mdash; strange<br>
as creeping tides against a bare black wall?"<br>
&mdash; when hearts once crush their grapes and close the grange,<br>
life is an evil. secret known to all,<br>
</p>

<p>
'tis but the common grief each man betrays<br>
to all, as you your joy, in eyes or brow<br>
so veil, my fair one, your inquiring gaze<br>
and though your voice is low, be silent now!<br>
</p>

<p>
be silent, simple soul! mouth always gay<br>
with girlish laughter! more than Life, today,<br>
Death binds our hearts with tenuous webs of doom;<br>
</p>

<p>
let mine be drunken with the wine of lies,<br>
o let me delve for dreams in those deep eyes<br>
and slumber long beneath your eyebrows' gloom!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Lewis Piaget Shanks, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (New York: Ives Washburn, 1931)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Semper Eadem</b><br>
</p>

<p>
"Whence," ask you, "is this heavy sadness shed. <br>
Rising like ocean round the bare black stone?"<br>
When the heart's crop has once been harvested <br>
Life is a burden! 'Tis of all men known. <br>
</p>

<p>
A simple grief and not mysterious, <br>
Blown like thy joy for all the world: so cease, <br>
Cease, O fair questioner, to probe me thus, <br>
And, though thy voice be gentle, hold thy peace. <br>
</p>

<p>
Hold thy peace, rapturous one! Child's mouth so rife <br>
With merriment. Death's links with us oft seem <br>
Subtler than those which bind our souls to Life. <br>
</p>

<p>
Let, let my heart grow drunken with a lie, <br>
And plunge in thy great eyes as in a dream. <br>
And slumber 'neath thy lashes tranquilly! <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jack Collings Squire, <i>Poems and Baudelaire Flowers</i> (London: The New Age Press, Ltd, 1909)<br>

Two editions of <i>Fleurs du mal</i> were published in Baudelaire's lifetime &mdash; one in 1857 and an expanded edition in 1861. "Scraps" and censored poems were collected in <i>Les &Eacute;paves</i> in 1866. After Baudelaire died the following year, a "definitive" edition appeared in 1868.
