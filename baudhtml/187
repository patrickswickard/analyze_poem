<b>Un Voyage &agrave; Cyth&egrave;re</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Mon coeur, comme un oiseau, voltigeait tout joyeux<br>
Et planait librement &agrave; l'entour des cordages;<br>
Le navire roulait sous un ciel sans nuages;<br>
Comme un ange enivr&eacute; d'un soleil radieux.<br>
</p>

<p>
Quelle est cette &icirc;le triste et noire? &mdash; C'est Cyth&egrave;re,<br>
Nous dit-on, un pays fameux dans les chansons<br>
Eldorado banal de tous les vieux gar&ccedil;ons.<br>
Regardez, apr&egrave;s tout, c'est une pauvre terre.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; &Icirc;le des doux secrets et des f&ecirc;tes du coeur!<br>
De l'antique V&eacute;nus le superbe fant&ocirc;me<br>
Au-dessus de tes mers plane comme un ar&ocirc;me<br>
Et charge les esprits d'amour et de langueur.<br>
</p>

<p>
Belle &icirc;le aux myrtes verts, pleine de fleurs &eacute;closes,<br>
V&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;e &agrave; jamais par toute nation,<br>
O&ugrave; les soupirs des coeurs en adoration<br>
Roulent comme l'encens sur un jardin de roses<br>
</p>

<p>
Ou le roucoulement &eacute;ternel d'un ramier!<br>
&mdash; Cyth&egrave;re n'&eacute;tait plus qu'un terrain des plus maigres,<br>
Un d&eacute;sert rocailleux troubl&eacute; par des cris aigres.<br>
J'entrevoyais pourtant un objet singulier!<br>
</p>

<p>
Ce n'&eacute;tait pas un temple aux ombres bocag&egrave;res,<br>
O&ugrave; la jeune pr&ecirc;tresse, amoureuse des fleurs,<br>
Allait, le corps br&ucirc;l&eacute; de secr&egrave;tes chaleurs,<br>
Entreb&acirc;illant sa robe aux brises passag&egrave;res;<br>
</p>

<p>
Mais voil&agrave; qu'en rasant la c&ocirc;te d'assez pr&egrave;s<br>
Pour troubler les oiseaux avec nos voiles blanches,<br>
Nous v&icirc;mes que c'&eacute;tait un gibet &agrave; trois branches,<br>
Du ciel se d&eacute;tachant en noir, comme un cypr&egrave;s.<br>
</p>

<p>
De f&eacute;roces oiseaux perch&eacute;s sur leur p&acirc;ture<br>
D&eacute;truisaient avec rage un pendu d&eacute;j&agrave; m&ucirc;r,<br>
Chacun plantant, comme un outil, son bec impur<br>
Dans tous les coins saignants de cette pourriture;<br>
</p>

<p>
Les yeux &eacute;taient deux trous, et du ventre effondr&eacute;<br>
Les intestins pesants lui coulaient sur les cuisses,<br>
Et ses bourreaux, gorg&eacute;s de hideuses d&eacute;lices,<br>
L'avaient &agrave; coups de bec absolument ch&acirc;tr&eacute;.<br>
</p>

<p>
Sous les pieds, un troupeau de jaloux quadrup&egrave;des,<br>
Le museau relev&eacute;, tournoyait et r&ocirc;dait;<br>
Une plus grande b&ecirc;te au milieu s'agitait<br>
Comme un ex&eacute;cuteur entour&eacute; de ses aides.<br>
</p>

<p>
Habitant de Cyth&egrave;re, enfant d'un ciel si beau,<br>
Silencieusement tu souffrais ces insultes<br>
En expiation de tes inf&acirc;mes cultes<br>
Et des p&eacute;ch&eacute;s qui t'ont interdit le tombeau.<br>
</p>

<p>
Ridicule pendu, tes douleurs sont les miennes!<br>
Je sentis, &agrave; l'aspect de tes membres flottants,<br>
Comme un vomissement, remonter vers mes dents<br>
Le long fleuve de fiel des douleurs anciennes;<br>
</p>

<p>
Devant toi, pauvre diable au souvenir si cher,<br>
J'ai senti tous les becs et toutes les m&acirc;choires<br>
Des corbeaux lancinants et des panth&egrave;res noires<br>
Qui jadis aimaient tant &agrave; triturer ma chair.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Le ciel &eacute;tait charmant, la mer &eacute;tait unie;<br>
Pour moi tout &eacute;tait noir et sanglant d&eacute;sormais,<br>
H&eacute;las! et j'avais, comme en un suaire &eacute;pais,<br>
Le coeur enseveli dans cette all&eacute;gorie.<br>
</p>

<p>
Dans ton &icirc;le, &ocirc; V&eacute;nus! je n'ai trouv&eacute; debout<br>
Qu'un gibet symbolique o&ugrave; pendait mon image...<br>
&mdash; Ah! Seigneur! donnez-moi la force et le courage<br>
De contempler mon coeur et mon corps sans d&eacute;go&ucirc;t!<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>A Voyage to Cythera</b><br>
</p>

<p>
My heart like a bird was fluttering joyously <br>
And soaring freely around the rigging; <br>
Beneath a cloudless sky the ship was rolling <br>
Like an angel drunken with the radiant sun.<br>
</p>

<p>
What is this black, gloomy island? &mdash; It's Cythera, <br>
They tell us, a country celebrated in song, <br>
The banal Eldorado of old bachelors. <br>
Look at it; after all, it is a wretched land.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Island of sweet secrets, of the heart's festivals!<br>
The beautiful shade of ancient Venus <br>
Hovers above your seas like a perfume <br>
And fills all minds with love and languidness.<br>
</p>

<p>
Fair isle of green myrtle filled with full-blown flowers<br>
Ever venerated by all nations,<br>
Where the sighs of hearts in adoration<br>
Roll like incense over a garden of roses<br>
</p>

<p>
Or like the eternal cooing of wood-pigeons!<br>
&mdash; Cythera was now no more than the barrenest land,<br>
A rocky desert disturbed by shrill cries.<br>
But I caught a glimpse of a singular object!<br>
</p>

<p>
It was not a temple in the shade of a grove <br>
Where the youthful priestess, amorous of flowers, <br>
Was walking, her body hot with hidden passion, <br>
Half-opening her robe to the passing breezes;<br>
</p>

<p>
But behold! as we passed, hugging the shore <br>
So that we disturbed the sea-birds with our white sails, <br>
We saw it was a gallows with three arms <br>
Outlined in black like a cypress against the sky.<br>
</p>

<p>
Ferocious birds perched on their feast were savagely <br>
Destroying the ripe corpse of a hanged man; <br>
Each plunged his filthy beak as though it were a tool <br>
Into every corner of that bloody putrescence;<br>
</p>

<p>
The eyes were two holes and from the gutted belly <br>
The heavy intestines hung down along his thighs <br>
And his torturers, gorged with hideous delights, <br>
Had completely castrated him with their sharp beaks.<br>
</p>

<p>
Below his feet a pack of jealous quadrupeds <br>
Prowled with upraised muzzles and circled round and round; <br>
One beast, larger than the others, moved in their midst <br>
Like a hangman surrounded by his aides.<br>
</p>

<p>
Cytherean, child of a sky so beautiful, <br>
You endured those insults in silence <br>
To expiate your infamous adorations <br>
And the sins which denied to you a grave.<br>
</p>

<p>
Ridiculous hanged man, your sufferings are mine! <br>
I felt at the sight of your dangling limbs <br>
The long, bitter river of my ancient sorrows <br>
Rise up once more like vomit to my teeth;<br>
</p>

<p>
Before you, poor devil of such dear memory <br>
I felt all the stabbing beaks of the crows <br>
And the jaws of the black panthers who loved so much <br>
In other days to tear my flesh to shreds.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; The sky was charming and the sea was smooth; <br>
For me thenceforth all was black and bloody, <br>
Alas! and I had in that allegory <br>
Wrapped up my heart as in a heavy shroud.<br>
</p>

<p>
On your isle, O Venus! I found upright only <br>
A symbolic gallows from which hung my image...<br>
O! Lord! give me the strength and the courage <br>
To contemplate my body and soul without loathing!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Voyage to Cytherea</b>
</p>

<p>
My heart, a bird, seemed joyfully to fly <br>
And round the rigging cruised with nimble gyre. <br>
The vessel rolled beneath the cloudless sky <br>
Like a white angel, drunk with solar fire.<br>
</p>

<p>
What is that sad, black island like a pall? <br>
Why, Cytherea, famed in many a book, <br>
The Eldorado of old-stagers. Look: <br>
It's but a damned poor country after all!<br>
</p>

<p>
Isle of sweet secrets and heart-feasting fire! <br>
Of antique Venus the majestic ghost <br>
Rolls like a storm of fragrance from your coast <br>
Filling our souls with languor and desire!<br>
</p>

<p>
Isle of green myrtles, where each flower uncloses,<br>
Adored by nations till the end of time:<br>
Sighs of adoring hearts, like incense, climb.<br>
And pour their perfume over sheaves of roses,<br>
</p>

<p>
Or groves of turtles in an endless coo! <br>
But no! it was a waste where nothing grows, <br>
Torn only by the raucous cries of crows: <br>
Yet there a curious object rose in view.<br>
</p>

<p>
This was no temple hid in bosky trees, <br>
Where the young priestess, amorous of flowers, <br>
Whom secretly a loving flame devours, <br>
Walks with her robe half-open to the breeze.<br>
</p>

<p>
For as we moved inshore to coast the shallows <br>
And our white canvas scared the crows to fly, <br>
Like a tall cypress, blackened on the sky, <br>
We saw it was a gaunt three-forking gallows.<br>
</p>

<p>
Fierce birds, perched on their meal, began to slash <br>
And rip with rage a rotten corpse that swung. <br>
Each screwed and chiselled with its beak among <br>
The crisp and bleeding crannies of the hash.<br>
</p>

<p>
His eyes were holes: from open stomach direly <br>
His heavy tripes cascaded to his thighs. <br>
Gorged with such ghastly dainties to the eyes, <br>
His torturers had gelded him entirely.<br>
</p>

<p>
Beneath, some jealous prowling quadrupeds, <br>
With lifted muzzles, for the leavings scrambled. <br>
The largest seemed, as in the midst he gambolled, <br>
An executioner among his aides.<br>
</p>

<p>
Native of Cytherea's cloudless clime <br>
In silent suffering you paid the price, <br>
And expiated ancient cults of vice <br>
With generations of forbidden crime.<br>
</p>

<p>
Ridiculous hanged man! Your griefs I know. <br>
I felt, to see you swing above the heath, <br>
Like nausea slowly rising to my teeth, <br>
The bilious stream of ancient human woe.<br>
</p>

<p>
Poor devil, dear to memory! before me <br>
I seemed to feel each talon, fang, and beak <br>
Of all the stinking crows and panthers sleek <br>
That in my lifetime ever chewed and tore me.<br>
</p>

<p>
The sky was charming and the sea unclouded, <br>
But all was black and bloody to my mind. <br>
As in a dismal winding-sheet entwined, <br>
My heart was in this allegory shrouded.<br>
</p>

<p>
A gallows where my image hung apart<br>
Was all I found on Venus' isle of sighs.<br>
O God, give me the strength to scrutinise,<br>
Without disgust, my body and my heart!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>


<p>
<b>A Voyage to Cythera</b><br>
</p>

<p>
My heart, that seemed a bird, was flying in the sun <br>
Before the mast &mdash; was flying joyously ahead: <br>
The ship, too, like an angel, all her sails outspread, <br>
Calmly beneath the unclouded sky flew on and on.<br>
</p>

<p>
What is that somber island? what dreary port of call? <br>
"Cythera," someone laughs &mdash; "the legend of the seas, <br>
Time-honoured Eldorado of aging debauchees. <br>
Look! It is only a poor, bleak country, after all."<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; O island of sweet revels and the sounding lyre!<br>
O shore of unimaginable secrets, where<br>
The shade of Venus walks upon the twilight air,<br>
Drugging the very soul with languor and desire!<br>
</p>

<p>
O island of green myrtles never withering!<br>
Thy long renown, by every human tongue confessed,<br>
To the far-scattered nations of the east and west<br>
Is wafted, like the perfume of an endless spring<br>
</p>

<p>
Or like a dove's nostalgic and eternal moan!<br>
&mdash; Cythera had become, in truth, a wretched land, <br>
A sullen desert glittering with rock and sand: <br>
I saw along those shores one sign of life alone.<br>
</p>

<p>
It was no antique temple nor the ruin thereof, <br>
Where a young priestess wanders, her light robes unpent, <br>
Confusing with the scent of flowers the virgin scent <br>
Of her slim body secretly aflame for love.<br>
</p>

<p>
No; but we could see clearly, having come so nigh <br>
That the shore-birds were scolding and beating upon our sails, <br>
A solitary gibbet constructed of three rails, <br>
Funereal as a tall dead cypress against the sky.<br>
</p>

<p>
Some vultures were destroying with energy and address <br>
A hanged man, ripe already by perhaps a week &mdash; <br>
Each planting carefully, like a sharp tool, his beak <br>
In every comer of that dangling rottenness.<br>
</p>

<p>
The eyes were holes; from the torn groin meandering <br>
On to the thighs, streamed down the intestines blue and bright; <br>
Not to be cheated of any possible delight, <br>
Those birds had absolutely castrated the poor thing.<br>
</p>

<p>
Below, a pack of jealous wolves, impatient for <br>
The still suspended, speedily diminishing feast, <br>
Wove round with lifted muzzles. One gigantic beast <br>
Was like an executioner among his corps.<br>
</p>

<p>
Son of Cythera! remnant of a world so brave! <br>
How silently, with thy black hollow eyes of woe, <br>
Didst thou hang there, in payment for I do not know <br>
What desperate crime forbidding thee an honest grave.<br>
</p>

<p>
Helpless and abject creature! Who art thou but I? <br>
Beholding thee, I could feel rise into my breast, <br>
Like a long bitter vomit, all the sick repressed <br>
Griefs and humiliations of the years gone by.<br>
</p>

<p>
At sight of thee, poor devil, I could feel the whole <br>
Rage of the past upon me &mdash; every beak and tooth <br>
Of those wild birds and animals that in my youth <br>
Loved tirelessly to lacerate my flesh and soul.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; The sea was calm and beautiful, the sky was clear: <br>
What shadow covered them and hid them from my eyes? <br>
The shadow cast by that symbolic tree! It lies <br>
Upon my heart like a black pall for ever, I fear.<br>
</p>

<p>
Naught else, O Venus, in thy whole dominion &mdash; just<br>
That mournful allegory to greet me, in my hour.<br>
Almighty God! Give me the courage and the power<br>
To contemplate my own true image without disgust!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; George Dillon, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>A Voyage to Cythera</b> <br>
</p>

<p>
If my heart was alive<br>
Switched to excitement<br>
As I felt the sea spray<br>
Hitting the flesh<br>
Then it weakened when told "The island we're passing is Cythera,<br>
Stockyard of the unarousable, Eldorado of the miserably fuckless<br>
Who now extract their pleasures<br>
from fantasy and pain!"<br>
</p>

<p>
But you were once the island of triumphant sensuality,<br>
Yes! Venus landed here on her hydrophonic seashell to<br>
Pour the perfume of love into the world.  Now it's anguish  <br>
A wet Iliad lotus of mental war and kids perpetually excited<br>
In the radioactive summer heat.<br>
</p>

<p>
Cythera, you're a shale and sandstone rock pulverized<br>
By excessive demands and impossible infatuations. The<br>
Priestesses you would expect have been ravished by working feverishly<br>
On their backs there, do not exist. Some different existence<br>
Decants itself: something for the sighs of the blasted<br>
And the ravings of those who have forgotten how to take it.<br>
</p>

<p>
As we rounded the headland<br>
The isle's central scene slid into view.<br>
A man hung on a gibbet engulfed by a cluster of<br>
Screeching ravens that were plunging their diseased<br>
Scalpels into every part of the anatomy, fighting for<br>
The tastier and choicer organs and flesh. His<br>
Intestines drooped out of the stomach coiled like<br>
Purple/grey colored sausages. The birds attacked,<br>
Popped the membranes, causing the intestinal fluid<br>
To run over the castrated groin and serrated thighs.<br>
The arms, dangling from only a few tissues of muscle,<br>
Swayed circularly in the wind until pecked off by<br>
Smallish, intellectual members of the flock.<br>
</p>

<p>
A stream of vomit cruised back and forth behind my clenched teeth.<br>
The shore scene washed around in my throat and head. The sea and sky<br>
Remained entangled in their uncaring dream while<br>
My heart flopped in my hands, stinging and hurting like a spiny fish.<br>
</p>

<p>
I realized that I would be sleeping in no more Augustinian nights,<br>
That I could look forward to never finding a satisfiable lover.<br>
Each of my sins and thoughts had become one of those birds<br>
Groping its way through my flesh in search of my shuddering soul.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Will Schmitz<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>A Voyage to Cythera</b><br>
</p>

<p>
My heart was like a bird and took to flight, <br>
Around the rigging circling joyously; <br>
The ship rolled on beneath a cloudless sky <br>
Like a great angel drunken with the light. <br>
</p>

<p>
"What is yon isle, sad and funereal?"<br>
"Cythera, famed in deathless song," say they, <br>
"The gay old bachelors' Eldorado &mdash; Nay, <br>
Look! 'tis a poor bare country after all!"<br>
</p>

<p>
Isle of sweet secrets and heart banquetings! <br>
The queenly shade of antique Venus thrills <br>
Scentlike above thy level seas and fills <br>
Our souls with languor and all amorous things. <br>
</p>

<p>
Fair island of green myrtles and blown flowers <br>
Held holy by all men for evermore. <br>
Where the faint sighs of spirits that adore <br>
Float like rose-incense through the quiet hours, <br>
</p>

<p>
And dovelike sounds each murmured orison: &mdash; <br>
Cythera lay there barren 'neath bright skies, <br>
A rocky waste rent by discordant cries: <br>
Natheless I saw a curious thing thereon. <br>
</p>

<p>
No shady temple was it, close enshrined <br>
I' the trees; no flower-crowned priestess hither came <br>
With her young body burnt by secret flame, <br>
Baring her breast to the caressing wind; <br>
</p>

<p>
But when so close to the land's edge we drew <br>
Our canvas scared the sea-fowl &mdash; gradually <br>
We knew it for a three-branched gallows tree <br>
Like a black cypress stark against the blue. <br>
</p>

<p>
A rotten carcase hung, whereon did sit <br>
A swarm of foul black birds; with writhe and shriek <br>
Each sought to pierce and plunge his knife-like beak <br>
Deep in the bleeding trunk and limbs of it. <br>
</p>

<p>
The eyes were holes; the belly opened wide, <br>
Streaming its heavy entrails on the thighs; <br>
The grim birds, gorged with dreadful delicacies. <br>
Had dug and furrowed it on every side.<br>
</p>

<p>
Beneath the blackened feet there strove and pressed <br>
A herd of jealous beasts with upward snout, <br>
And in the midst of these there turned about <br>
One, the chief hangman, larger than the rest...<br>
</p>

<p>
Lone Cytherean! now all silently <br>
Thou sufferest these insults to atone <br>
For those old infamous sins that thou hast known, <br>
The sins that locked the gate o' the grave to thee. <br>
</p>

<p>
Mine are thy sorrows, ludicrous corse; yea, all <br>
Are mine! I stood thy swaying limbs beneath, <br>
And, like a bitter vomit, to my teeth <br>
There rose old sorrows in a stream of gall. <br>
</p>

<p>
O thou unhappy devil, I felt afresh, <br>
Gazing at thee, the beaks and jaws of those <br>
Black savage panthers and those ruthless crows, <br>
Who loved of old to macerate my flesh. <br>
</p>

<p>
The sea was calm, the sky without a cloud; <br>
Henceforth for me all things that came to pass <br>
Were blood and darkness, &mdash; round my heart, alas! <br>
There clung that allegory, like a shroud. <br>
</p>

<p>
Naught save mine image on a gibbet thrust <br>
Found I on Venus island desolate...<br>
Ah, God! the courage and strength to contemplate <br>
My body and my heart without disgust! <br>
</p>
