<b><i>Tu mettrais l'univers entier dans ta ruelle</i></b><br>
</p>

<p>
Tu mettrais l'univers entier dans ta ruelle,<br>
Femme impure! L'ennui rend ton &acirc;me cruelle.<br>
Pour exercer tes dents &agrave; ce jeu singulier,<br>
Il te faut chaque jour un coeur au r&acirc;telier.<br>
Tes yeux, illumin&eacute;s ainsi que des boutiques<br>
Et des ifs flamboyants dans les f&ecirc;tes publiques,<br>
Usent insolemment d'un pouvoir emprunt&eacute;,<br>
Sans conna&icirc;tre jamais la loi de leur beaut&eacute;.<br>
</p>

<p>
Machine aveugle et sourde, en cruaut&eacute;s f&eacute;conde!<br>
Salutaire instrument, buveur du sang du monde,<br>
Comment n'as-tu pas honte et comment n'as-tu pas<br>
Devant tous les miroirs vu p&acirc;lir tes appas?<br>
La grandeur de ce mal o&ugrave; tu te crois savante<br>
Ne t'a donc jamais fait reculer d'&eacute;pouvante,<br>
Quand la nature, grande en ses desseins cach&eacute;s,<br>
De toi se sert, &ocirc; femme, &ocirc; reine des p&eacute;ch&eacute;s,<br>
&mdash; De toi, vil animal, &mdash; pour p&eacute;trir un g&eacute;nie?<br>
</p>

<p>
&Ocirc; fangeuse grandeur! sublime ignominie!<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b><i>You Would Take the Whole World to Bed with You</i></b><br>
</p>

<p>
You would take the whole world to bed with you, <br>
Impure woman! Ennui makes your soul cruel; <br>
To exercise your teeth at this singular game, <br>
You need a new heart in the rack each day. <br>
Your eyes, brilliant as shop windows <br>
Or as blazing lamp-stands at public festivals, <br>
Insolently use a borrowed power <br>
Without ever knowing the law of their beauty.<br>
</p>

<p>
Blind, deaf machine, fecund in cruelties! <br>
Remedial instrument, drinker of the world's blood, <br>
Why are you not ashamed and why have you not seen <br>
In every looking-glass how your charms are fading? <br>
Why have you never shrunk at the enormity <br>
Of this evil at which you think you are expert, <br>
When Nature, resourceful in her hidden designs, <br>
Makes use of you, woman, O queen of sin, <br>
Of you, vile animal, &mdash; to fashion a genius?<br>
</p>

<p>
O foul magnificence! Sublime ignominy!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b><i>You'd Stick the World into Your Bedside Lane</i></b>
</p>

<p>
You'd stick the world into your bedside lane. <br>
It's boredom makes you callous to all pain. <br>
To exercise your teeth for this strange task, <br>
A heart upon a rake, each day, you'd ask. <br>
Your eyes lit up like shopfronts, or the trees <br>
With lanterns on the night of public sprees, <br>
Make insolent misuse of borrowed power <br>
And scorn the law of beauty that's their dower.<br>
</p>

<p>
Oh deaf-and-dumb machine, harm-breeding fool <br>
World sucking leech, yet salutary tool! <br>
Have you not seen your beauties blanch to pass <br>
Before their own reflection in the glass? <br>
Before this pain, in which you think you're wise, <br>
Does not its greatness shock you with surprise, <br>
To think that Nature, deep in projects hidden, <br>
Has chosen you, vile creature of the midden, <br>
To knead a genius for succeeding time.<br>
</p>

<p>
O sordid grandeur! Infamy sublime!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>You Hungry Bitch</b>
</p>

<p>
You hungry bitch,<br>
You'd take the galaxy to bed!<br>
Surely, life's a bore<br>
Unless you grind a heart between your teeth to keep your gums healthy.<br>
Your eyes,<br>
glittering like carnival lights,<br>
dance into the night--<br>
a torch-lit grandstand in July!<br>
They strike without mercy in their glowing beauty:<br>
Don't you know that eyes have claws even in their radiance?<br>
</p>

<p>
Robust as an engine,<br>
senselessly pumping out your savageries,<br>
sightlessly sucking up the world's blood!<br>
How is it<br>
you never see your allurements vanish in a mirror?<br>
How is it<br>
(and this makes your guilt egregious that you think you have a mind)<br>
you never draw back in horror<br>
when Nature,<br>
awesome in its curious designs,<br>
has chosen you,<br>
woman,<br>
you,<br>
queen of vices,<br>
you,<br>
you stinking animal,<br>
to birth <br>
a genius?<br>
</p>

<p>
O filthy glory!<br>
O sublime hellishness!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Edward Eriksson
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Tyranny of Woman</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Aye, you would bed with the whole universe, <br>
Lewd woman! Ennui makes your soul perverse; <br>
Cruel, you whet your teeth at this weird play, <br>
You need a fresh heart in the rack each day. <br>
Your eyes blaze like illumined shops or lights <br>
Of serried lamps on festive public nights,<br>
They use a borrowed puissance haughtily <br>
Unconscious of their beauty's tyranny.<br>
</p>

<p>
Blind, deaf machine, geared to increase man's pain, <br>
Tool primed to suckle blood from his last vein, <br>
Have you no shame when every looking glass <br>
Betrays your faded beauties as you pass, <br>
When cunning Nature's hidden plans begin <br>
To use you, beast! woman, vile queen of sin, <br>
To fashion genius in carnality?<br>
</p>

<p>
O shameless might! Sublime ignominy!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jacques LeClercq, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (Mt Vernon, NY: Peter Pauper Press, 1958)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b><i>You'd Take the Entire Universe to Bed with You</i></b><br>
</p>

<p>
You'd take the entire universe to bed with you, <br>
I think, just out of boredom, you lecherous, idle shrew!<br>
You need, to keep your teeth sound, exercise your jaws, <br>
Daily, for dinner, some new heart between your paws! <br>
Your eyes, all lighted up like shops, like public fairs, <br>
How insolent they are! &mdash; as if their power were theirs <br>
Indeed! &mdash; this borrowed power, this Beauty, you direct <br>
And use, whose law, however, you do not suspect.<br>
</p>

<p>
Unwholesome instrument for health, O deaf machine <br>
And blind, fecund in tortures! &mdash; how is it you have not seen, <br>
You drinker of the world's blood, your mirrored loveliness <br>
Blench and recoil? how is it you feel no shame? confess: <br>
Has never, then, this evil's very magnitude <br>
Caused you to stagger? &mdash; you, who think yourself so shrewd <br>
In evil? &mdash; seeing how Nature, patient and abstruse &mdash; <br>
O Woman, Queen of Sins, Vile Animal, &mdash; has made use <br>
Of you, to mould a genius? &mdash; employed you all this time?<br>
</p>

<p>
O muddy grandeur! &mdash; ignominy ironic and sublime!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Edna St. Vincent Millay, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>

Two editions of <i>Fleurs du mal</i> were published in Baudelaire's lifetime &mdash; one in 1857 and an expanded edition in 1861. "Scraps" and censored poems were collected in <i>Les &Eacute;paves</i> in 1866. After Baudelaire died the following year, a "definitive" edition appeared in 1868.
