<b>L'Ennemi</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Ma jeunesse ne fut qu'un t&eacute;n&eacute;breux orage,<br>
Travers&eacute; &ccedil;&agrave; et l&agrave; par de brillants soleils;<br>
Le tonnerre et la pluie ont fait un tel ravage,<br>
Qu'il reste en mon jardin bien peu de fruits vermeils.<br>
</p>

<p>
Voil&agrave; que j'ai touch&eacute; l'automne des id&eacute;es,<br>
Et qu'il faut employer la pelle et les r&acirc;teaux<br>
Pour rassembler &agrave; neuf les terres inond&eacute;es,<br>
O&ugrave; l'eau creuse des trous grands comme des tombeaux.<br>
</p>

<p>
Et qui sait si les fleurs nouvelles que je r&ecirc;ve<br>
Trouveront dans ce sol lav&eacute; comme une gr&egrave;ve<br>
Le mystique aliment qui ferait leur vigueur?<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; &Ocirc; douleur! &ocirc; douleur! Le Temps mange la vie,<br>
Et l'obscur Ennemi qui nous ronge le coeur<br>
Du sang que nous perdons cro&icirc;t et se fortifie!<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>The Enemy</b>
</p>

<p>
My youth has been nothing but a tenebrous storm, <br>
Pierced now and then by rays of brilliant sunshine; <br>
Thunder and rain have wrought so much havoc <br>
That very few ripe fruits remain in my garden.<br>
</p>

<p>
I have already reached the autumn of the mind, <br>
And I must set to work with the spade and the rake <br>
To gather back the inundated soil <br>
In which the rain digs holes as big as graves.<br>
</p>

<p>
And who knows whether the new flowers I dream of <br>
Will find in this earth washed bare like the strand, <br>
The mystic aliment that would give them vigor?<br>
</p>

<p>
Alas! Alas! Time eats away our lives, <br>
And the hidden Enemy who gnaws at our hearts <br>
Grows by drawing strength from the blood we lose!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Enemy</b>
</p>

<p>
My youth was but a tempest, dark and savage, <br>
Through which, at times, a dazzling sun would shoot <br>
The thunder and the rain have made such ravage <br>
My garden is nigh bare of rosy fruit.<br>
</p>

<p>
Now I have reached the Autumn of my thought, <br>
And spade and rake must toil the land to save, <br>
That fragments of my flooded fields be sought <br>
From where the water sluices out a grave.<br>
</p>

<p>
Who knows if the new flowers my dreams prefigure, <br>
In this washed soil should find, as by a sluit, <br>
The mystic nourishment to give them vigour?<br>
</p>

<p>
Time swallows up our life, O ruthless rigour!<br>
And the dark foe that nibbles our heart's root, <br>
Grows on our blood the stronger and the bigger!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Enemy</b>
</p>

<p>
My youth was a dark storm,<br>
Crossed here and there by brilliant suns;<br>
Thunder and rain have caused such quick ravage<br>
That there remain in my garden very few red fruits.<br>
</p>

<p>
Now I have touched the autumn of my mind,<br>
And I must use the spade and rakes<br>
To assemble again the drenched lands,<br>
Where the water digs holes as large as graves.<br>
</p>

<p>
And who knows whether the new flowers I dream of<br>
Will find in this soil washed like a shore<br>
The mystic food which would create their strength?<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; О grief! О grief! Time eats away life,<br>
And the dark Enemy who gnaws the heart<br>
Grows and thrives on the blood we lose.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Wallace Fowlie, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (New York: Dover Publications, 1964)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Ruined Garden</b><br>
</p>

<p>
My childhood was only a menacing shower,<br>
cut now and ten by hours of brilliant heat.<br>
All the top soil was killed by rain and sleet,<br>
my garden hardly bore a standing flower.<br>
</p>

<p>
From now on, my mind's autumn! I must take<br>
the field and dress my beds with spade and rake<br>
and restore order to my flooded grounds.<br>
There the rain raised mountains like burial mounds.<br>
</p>

<p>
I throw fresh seeds out. Who knows what survives?<br>
What elements will give us life and food?<br>
This soil is irrigated by the tides.<br>
</p>

<p>
Time and nature sluice away our lives.<br>
A virus eats the heart out of our sides,<br>
digs in and multiplies on our lost blood.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Robert Lowell, from Marthiel &amp; Jackson Matthews, eds., <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: New Directions, 1963)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Enemy</b><br>
</p>

<p>
I think of my gone youth as of a stormy sky <br>
Infrequently transpierced by a benignant sun; <br>
Tempest and hail have done their work; and what have I? &mdash; <br>
How many fruits in my torn garden? &mdash; scarcely one.<br>
</p>

<p>
And now that I approach the autumn of my mind, <br>
And must reclaim once more the inundated earth &mdash; <br>
Washed into stony trenches deep as graves I find <br>
I wield the rake and hoe, asking, "What is it worth?"<br>
</p>

<p>
Who can assure me, these new flowers for which I toil <br>
Will find in the disturbed and reconstructed soil <br>
That mystic aliment on which alone they thrive?<br>
</p>

<p>
Oh, anguish, anguish! Time eats up all things alive; <br>
And that unseen, dark Enemy, upon the spilled <br>
Bright blood we could not spare, battens, and is fulfilled.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Edna St. Vincent Millay, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Enemy</b>
</p>

<p>
My childhood was nought but a ravaging storm, <br>
Enlivened at times by a brilliant sun;<br>
The rain and the winds wrought such havoc and harm <br>
That of buds on my plot there remains hardly one. <br>
</p>

<p>
Behold now the Fall of ideas I have reached, <br>
And the shovel and rake one must therefore resume, <br>
In collecting the turf, inundated and breached, <br>
Where the waters dug trenches as deep as a tomb. <br>
</p>

<p>
And yet these new blossoms, for which I craved, <br>
Will they find in this earth &mdash; like a shore that is laved &mdash;<br>
The mystical fuel which vigour imparts? <br>
</p>

<p>
Oh misery! &mdash; Time devours our lives, <br>
And the enemy black, which consumeth our hearts <br>
On the blood of our bodies, increases and thrives! <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Cyril Scott, <i>Baudelaire: The Flowers of Evil</i> (London: Elkin Mathews, 1909)
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>L'Ennemi</b><br>
</p>

<p>
my youth was all a murky hurricane;<br>
not oft did the suns of splendour burst the gloom;<br>
so wild the lightning raged, so fierce the rain,<br>
few crimson fruits my garden-close illume.<br>
</p>

<p>
now I have touched the autumn of the mind,<br>
I must repair and smooth the earth, to save<br>
my little seed-plot, torn and undermined,<br>
guttered and gaping like an open grave.<br>
</p>

<p>
and will the flowers all my dreams implore<br>
draw from this garden wasted like a shore<br>
some rich mysterious power the storm imparts?<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; o grief! o grief! time eats away our lives,<br>
and the dark Enemy gnawing at our hearts<br>
sucks from our blood the strength whereon he thrives!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Lewis Piaget Shanks, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (New York: Ives Washburn, 1931)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Enemy</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Naught but a long blind tempest was my youth, <br>
Sun-shot at times; the thunder and the rain <br>
Have worked their havock with so little ruth <br>
That in my garden few red fruits remain. <br>
</p>

<p>
Now have I reached the autumn of my thought, <br>
And shovel and pick must use some soil to save <br>
From out the ruins that the rain hath wrought <br>
Where all around great pits gape like the grave. <br>
</p>

<p>
Who knows if these last flowers of my dreams <br>
Shall find beneath this naked strand that streams <br>
The mystic substance which their strength imparts? <br>
</p>

<p>
O misery! misery! Time eats our lives, <br>
And that dark Enemy who gnaws our hearts <br>
Grows by the blood he sucks from us, and thrives. <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jack Collings Squire, <i>Poems and Baudelaire Flowers</i> (London: The New Age Press, Ltd, 1909)<br>
