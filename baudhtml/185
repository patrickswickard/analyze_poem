<b>La B&eacute;atrice</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Dans des terrains cendreux, calcin&eacute;s, sans verdure,<br>
Comme je me plaignais un jour &agrave; la nature,<br>
Et que de ma pens&eacute;e, en vaguant au hasard,<br>
J'aiguisais lentement sur mon coeur le poignard,<br>
Je vis en plein midi descendre sur ma t&ecirc;te<br>
Un nuage fun&egrave;bre et gros d'une temp&ecirc;te,<br>
Qui portait un troupeau de d&eacute;mons vicieux,<br>
Semblables &agrave; des nains cruels et curieux.<br>
&Agrave; me consid&eacute;rer froidement ils se mirent,<br>
Et, comme des passants sur un fou qu'ils admirent,<br>
Je les entendis rire et chuchoter entre eux,<br>
En &eacute;changeant maint signe et maint clignement d'yeux:<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; &laquo;Contemplons &agrave; loisir cette caricature<br>
Et cette ombre d'Hamlet imitant sa posture,<br>
Le regard ind&eacute;cis et les cheveux au vent.<br>
N'est-ce pas grand'piti&eacute; de voir ce bon vivant,<br>
Ce gueux, cet histrion en vacances, ce dr&ocirc;le,<br>
Parce qu'il sait jouer artistement son r&ocirc;le,<br>
Vouloir int&eacute;resser au chant de ses douleurs<br>
Les aigles, les grillons, les ruisseaux et les fleurs,<br>
Et m&ecirc;me &agrave; nous, auteurs de ces vieilles rubriques,<br>
R&eacute;citer en hurlant ses tirades publiques?&raquo;<br>
</p>

<p>
J'aurais pu (mon orgueil aussi haut que les monts<br>
Domine la nu&eacute;e et le cri des d&eacute;mons)<br>
D&eacute;tourner simplement ma t&ecirc;te souveraine,<br>
Si je n'eusse pas vu parmi leur troupe obsc&egrave;ne,<br>
Crime qui n'a pas fait chanceler le soleil!<br>
La reine de mon coeur au regard nonpareil<br>
Qui riait avec eux de ma sombre d&eacute;tresse<br>
Et leur versait parfois quelque sale caresse.<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>Beatrice</b><br>
</p>

<p>
One day as I was making complaint to nature <br>
In a burnt, ash-gray land without vegetation, <br>
And as I wandered aimlessly, slowly whetting <br>
Upon my heart the dagger of my thought, <br>
I saw in broad daylight descending on my head <br>
A leaden cloud, pregnant with a tempest, <br>
That carried a herd of vicious demons <br>
Who resembled curious, cruel dwarfs. <br>
They began to look at me coldly, <br>
And I heard them laugh and whisper to each other, <br>
Exchanging many a sign and many a wink <br>
Like passers-by who discuss a fool they admire:<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; "Let us look leisurely at this caricature, <br>
This shade of Hamlet who imitates his posture <br>
With indecisive look, hair streaming in the wind. <br>
Is it not a pity to see this bon vivant, <br>
This tramp, this queer fish, this actor without a job, <br>
Because he knows how to play skillfully his role, <br>
Wish to interest in the song of his woes <br>
The eagles, the crickets, the brooks, and the flowers, <br>
And even to us, authors of that hackneyed drivel, <br>
Bellow the recital of his public tirades?"<br>
</p>

<p>
I could have (my pride as high as mountains <br>
Dominates the clouds and the cries of the demons) <br>
Simply turned away my sovereign head <br>
If I had not seen in that obscene troop <br>
A crime which did not make the sun reel in its course! <br>
The queen of my heart with the peerless gaze <br>
Laughing with them at my somber distress <br>
And giving them at times a lewd caress.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Beatrice</b>
</p>

<p>
In charred and ashen fields without a leaf,<br>
While I alone to Nature told my grief,<br>
I sharpened, as I went, like any dart,<br>
My thought upon the grindstone of my heart &mdash; <br>
When by a troop of vicious demons led,<br>
A great black cloud rushed down towards my head.<br>
As loafers at a lunatic they leered<br>
And in my face inquisitively peered.<br>
With nods and signs, like dwarfed and apish elves,<br>
They laughed, and winked, and spoke among themselves.<br>
</p>

<p>
"This parody of Hamlet, take his measure, <br>
And contemplate the travesty at leisure. <br>
Is it not sad to see the puzzled stare, <br>
The halting gait, and the dishevelled hair <br>
With which this clownish actor, on half-pay, <br>
Because he is an artist in his way, <br>
Attempts to interest, in the griefs he sings, <br>
Eagles, and crickets, flowers, and running springs, <br>
And even us, the authors of his woe, <br>
Howling his sorrows as a public show?"<br>
</p>

<p>
I could have dominated with my pride <br>
That horde of demons and the taunts they cried, <br>
Just by the mere aversion of my face &mdash; <br>
Had I not seen, amongst that evil race, <br>
(A crime that did not even daze the sun!) <br>
Queen of my heart, the peerless, only one, <br>
Laughing with them to see my dark distress, <br>
And giving them, at times, some lewd caress.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>


<p>
<b>My Beatrice</b><br>
</p>

<p>
While I was walking in a pitted place,<br>
crying aloud against the human race,<br>
letting thoughts ramble here and there apart &mdash;<br>
knives singing on the whetstones in my heart &mdash;<br>
I saw a cloud descending on my head<br>
in the full noon, a cloud inhabited<br>
by black devils, sharp, humped, inquisitive<br>
as dwarfs. They knew where I was sensitive,<br>
now idling there, and looked me up and down,<br>
as cool delinquents watch a madman clown.<br>
I heard them laugh and snicker blasphemies,<br>
while swapping signs and blinking with their eyes.<br>
</p>

<p>
"Let's stop and watch this creature at our leisure &mdash;<br>
all sighs and sweaty hair. We'll take his measure.<br>
It's a great pity that this mountebank<br>
and ghost of Hamlet strutting on his plank<br>
should think he's such an artist at his role<br>
he has to rip the lining from his soul<br>
and paralyze the butterflies and bees<br>
with a peepshow of his indecencies &mdash;<br>
and even we, who gave him his education,<br>
must listen to his schoolboy declamation."<br>
</p>

<p>
Wishing to play a part (my pride was high<br>
above the mountains and the devil's cry)<br>
like Hamlet now, I would have turned my back,<br>
had I not seen among the filthy pack<br>
(Oh crime that should have made the sun drop dead!)<br>
my heart's queen and the mistress of my bed<br>
there purring with the rest at my distress,<br>
and sometimes tossing them a stale caress.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Robert Lowell, from Marthiel &amp; Jackson Matthews, eds., <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: New Directions, 1963)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Beatrice</b><br>
</p>

<p>
In a burned-over land, where not a blade or leaf <br>
Showed green, through a charred world, whetting my ancient grief <br>
Slowly upon my heart, and making sad lament <br>
To Nature, at broad noon, not knowing where I went, <br>
I walked... and saw above me a big cloud &mdash; which at first <br>
I took to be a storm &mdash; blacken, and swell and burst, <br>
And pour upon my head instead of rain a rout <br>
Of demons, dwarfed and cruel, which ringed me all about. <br>
As passersby, no matter upon what errands bent, <br>
Will always stop and stare with cold astonishment <br>
At some poor man gone mad, then bait him wittily, <br>
Just so they gaped and nudged, and jeered aloud at me.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; "Come! Have a look at this! What is it, should you say?<br>
The shade of Hamlet &mdash; why, of course! &mdash; look at the way<br>
He stands! &mdash; that undecided eye! &mdash; the wild hair, too!<br>
Come here! Do look! Oh, wouldn't it wring a tear from you!<br>
This shabby bon-vivant, this pompous tramp, this ham-<br>
Actor out of a job, thinking that he can cram,<br>
By ranting, stale gesticulations, crocodile-tears,<br>
His tragic fate into the ears of crickets, into the ears<br>
Of eagles! &mdash; yes, who knows? &mdash; along with brooks and flowers<br>
Forgetting we invented these tricks, even into ours!"<br>
</p>

<p>
But for one thing &mdash; no mountain is taller than my pride; <br>
No demon horde can scale me &mdash; I could have turned aside <br>
My sovereign thought, and stood alone... had I not seen <br>
Suddenly, amongst this loathsome troupe, <i>her,</i> my heart's queen &mdash; <br>
And the sun did not reel, it stood unmoved above! &mdash; <br>
Her of the pure deep gaze, my life, my peerless love, <br>
Mocking and pointing, laughing at my acute distress; <br>
Or fondling some foul dwarf in an obscene caress.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Edna St. Vincent Millay, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>La Beatrice</b>
</p>

<p>
In a burnt, ashen land, where no herb grew,<br>
I to the winds my cries of anguish threw;<br>
And in my thoughts, in that sad place apart,<br>
Pricked gently with the poignard o'er my heart.<br>
Then in full noon above my head a cloud<br>
Descended tempest-swollen, and a crowd<br>
Of wild, lascivious spirits huddled there,<br>
The cruel and curious demons of the air,<br>
Who coldly to consider me began;<br>
Then, as a crowd jeers some unhappy man,<br>
Exchanging gestures, winking with their eyes &mdash; <br>
I heard a laughing and a whispering rise:<br>
</p>

<p>
"Let us at leisure contemplate this clown,<br>
This shadow of Hamlet aping Hamlet's frown,<br>
With wandering eyes and hair upon the wind.<br>
Is't not a pity that this empty mind,<br>
This tramp, this actor out of work, this droll,<br>
Because he knows how to assume a rôle<br>
Should dream that eagles and insects, streams and woods,<br>
Stand still to hear him chaunt his dolorous moods?<br>
Even unto us, who made these ancient things,<br>
The fool his public lamentation sings."<br>
With pride as lofty as the towering cloud,<br>
I would have stilled these clamouring demons loud,<br>
And turned in scorn my sovereign head away<br>
Had I not seen &mdash; O sight to dim the day! &mdash; <br>
There in the middle of the troupe obscene<br>
The proud and peerless beauty of my Queen!<br>
She laughed with them at all my dark distress,<br>
And gave to each in turn a vile caress.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; F.P. Sturm, from <i>Baudelaire: His Prose and Poetry</i>, edited by Thomas Robert Smith (New York: Boni and Liveright, 1919)

Two editions of <i>Fleurs du mal</i> were published in Baudelaire's lifetime &mdash; one in 1857 and an expanded edition in 1861. "Scraps" and censored poems were collected in <i>Les &Eacute;paves</i> in 1866. After Baudelaire died the following year, a "definitive" edition appeared in 1868.
