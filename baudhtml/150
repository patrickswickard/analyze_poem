<b>Causerie</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Vous &ecirc;tes un beau ciel d'automne, clair et rose!<br>
Mais la tristesse en moi monte comme la mer,<br>
Et laisse, en refluant, sur ma l&egrave;vre morose<br>
Le souvenir cuisant de son limon amer.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Ta main se glisse en vain sur mon sein qui se p&acirc;me;<br>
Ce qu'elle cherche, amie, est un lieu saccag&eacute;<br>
Par la griffe et la dent f&eacute;roce de la femme.<br>
Ne cherchez plus mon coeur; les b&ecirc;tes l'ont mang&eacute;.<br>
</p>

<p>
Mon coeur est un palais fl&eacute;tri par la cohue;<br>
On s'y so&ucirc;le, on s'y tue, on s'y prend aux cheveux!<br>
&mdash; Un parfum nage autour de votre gorge nue!...<br>
</p>

<p>
&Ocirc; Beaut&eacute;, dur fl&eacute;au des &acirc;mes, tu le veux!<br>
Avec tes yeux de feu, brillants comme des f&ecirc;tes,<br>
Calcine ces lambeaux qu'ont &eacute;pargn&eacute;s les b&ecirc;tes!<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>Conversation</b><br>
</p>

<p>
You are a lovely autumn sky, clear and rosy! <br>
But sadness rises in me like the sea, <br>
And as it ebbs, leaves on my sullen lips <br>
The burning memory of its bitter slime.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; In vain does your hand slip over my swooning breast; <br>
What it seeks, darling, is a place plundered <br>
By the claws and the ferocious teeth of woman. <br>
Seek my heart no longer; the beasts have eaten it.<br>
</p>

<p>
My heart is a palace polluted by the mob;<br>
They get drunk there, kill, tear each other's hair!<br>
&mdash; A perfume floats about your naked breast!...<br>
</p>

<p>
O Beauty, ruthless scourge of souls, you desire it!<br>
With the fire of your eyes, brilliant as festivals,<br>
Bum these tatters which the beasts spared!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>

<p>
You're like an autumn sky, rose, clear, and placid. <br>
But sorrow whelms me, like the tide's assault, <br>
And ebbing, leaves upon my lips the acid <br>
And muddy-bitter memory of its salt.<br>
</p>

<p>
Your hand may stroke my breast, but not console. <br>
What it seeks there is but a hole, deep caverned <br>
By women's claws and fangs, and ransacked whole. <br>
Seek not my heart, on which the beasts have ravened.<br>
</p>

<p>
My heart's a palace plundered by the rabble: <br>
They tope, they kill, in blood and guts they scrabble:<br>
&mdash; A perfume swims around your naked breast!<br>
</p>

<p>
O Beauty, flail of spirits, you know best! <br>
With your eyes' fire, lit up as for a spree, <br>
Char the poor rags those beasts have left of me!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>

<p>
<b>Episode</b><br>
</p>

<p>
You are a lovely, rosy, lucid autumn sky! <br>
But sadness mounts upon me like a flooding sea, <br>
And ebbs, and ebbing, leaves my lips morose and dry, <br>
Smarting with salty ooze, bitter with memory.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Useless to slide your hand like that along my breast; <br>
That which it seeks, my dear, is plundered; it is slit <br>
By the soft paw of woman, that clawed while it caressed. <br>
Useless to hunt my heart; the beasts have eaten it.<br>
</p>

<p>
My heart is like a palace where the mob has spat;<br>
There they carouse, they seize each other's hair, they kill.<br>
&mdash; Your breast is naked... what exotic scent is that?...<br>
</p>

<p>
O Beauty, iron flail of souls, it is your will! <br>
So be it! Eyes of fire, bright in the darkness there, <br>
Bum up these strips of flesh the beasts saw fit to spare.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Edna St. Vincent Millay, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Causerie</b><br>
</p>

<p>
You are an autumn sky, suffused with rose...<br>
Yet sadness rises in me like the sea, <br>
And on my sombre lip, when it outflows. <br>
Leaves its salt burning slime for memory. <br>
</p>

<p>
Over my swooning breast your fingers stray; <br>
In vain, alas! My breast is a void pit <br>
Sacked by the tooth and claw of woman. Nay, <br>
Seek not my heart; the beasts have eaten it! <br>
</p>

<p>
My heart is as a palace plundered <br>
By the wolves, wherein they gorge and rend and kill, <br>
A perfume round thy naked throat is shed...<br>
</p>

<p>
Beauty, strong scourge of souls, O work thy will! <br>
Scorch with thy fiery eyes which shine like feasts <br>
These shreds of flesh rejected by the beasts! <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jack Collings Squire, <i>Poems and Baudelaire Flowers</i> (London: The New Age Press, Ltd, 1909)<br>

<p>
<b>The Eyes of Beauty</b>
</p>

<p>
You are a sky of autumn, pale and rose;<br>
But all the sea of sadness in my blood<br>
Surges, and ebbing, leaves my lips morose,<br>
Salt with the memory of the bitter flood.<br>
</p>

<p>
In vain your hand glides my faint bosom o'er,<br>
That which you seek, beloved, is desecrate<br>
By woman's tooth and talon; ah, no more<br>
Seek in me for a heart which those dogs ate.<br>
</p>

<p>
It is a ruin where the jackals rest,<br>
And rend and tear and glut themselves and slay &mdash; <br>
A perfume swims about your naked breast!<br>
</p>

<p>
Beauty, hard scourge of spirits, have your way!<br>
With flame-like eyes that at bright feasts have flared<br>
Burn up these tatters that the beasts have spared!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; F.P. Sturm, from <i>Baudelaire: His Prose and Poetry</i>, edited by Thomas Robert Smith (New York: Boni and Liveright, 1919)

<b>Conversation</b><br>
</p>

<p>
You are the loveliness, the clearness, the red of autumn skies!<br>
But sadness climbs like a sea in me, <br>
Leaving, in reflux, upon my bitter lip<br>
The sharp memory of its biting slime.<br>
</p>

<p>
 &mdash; In vain your hand slips on my fainting chest; <br>
What it seeks, my darling, is but a place pillaged <br>
By the fang and the fierce tooth of woman. <br>
Do not search for my heart anymore; the wild beasts have eaten it.<br>
</p>

<p>
My heart is a palace soiled by the mob;<br>
There they swill, and they brawl, and they kill!<br>
 &mdash; A fragrance swims around your naked breasts.<br>
</p>

<p>
O Beauty, cruel scourge of souls, you long for it!<br>
With your eyes that flame, brilliant as festivals,<br>
Bum these tatters that the beasts have spared me!<br>
</p>

Two editions of <i>Fleurs du mal</i> were published in Baudelaire's lifetime &mdash; one in 1857 and an expanded edition in 1861. "Scraps" and censored poems were collected in <i>Les &Eacute;paves</i> in 1866. After Baudelaire died the following year, a "definitive" edition appeared in 1868.
