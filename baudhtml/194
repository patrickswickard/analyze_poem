<b>Le Vin de l'assassin</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Ma femme est morte, je suis libre!<br>
Je puis donc boire tout mon so&ucirc;l.<br>
Lorsque je rentrais sans un sou,<br>
Ses cris me d&eacute;chiraient la fibre.<br>
</p>

<p>
Autant qu'un roi je suis heureux;<br>
L'air est pur, le ciel admirable...<br>
Nous avions un &eacute;t&eacute; semblable<br>
Lorsque j'en devins amoureux!<br>
</p>

<p>
L'horrible soif qui me d&eacute;chire<br>
Aurait besoin pour s'assouvir<br>
D'autant de vin qu'en peut tenir<br>
Son tombeau; &mdash; ce n'est pas peu dire:<br>
</p>

<p>
Je l'ai jet&eacute;e au fond d'un puits,<br>
Et j'ai m&ecirc;me pouss&eacute; sur elle<br>
Tous les pav&eacute;s de la margelle.<br>
&mdash; Je l'oublierai si je le puis!<br>
</p>

<p>
Au nom des serments de tendresse,<br>
Dont rien ne peut nous d&eacute;lier,<br>
Et pour nous r&eacute;concilier<br>
Comme au beau temps de notre ivresse,<br>
</p>

<p>
J'implorai d'elle un rendez-vous,<br>
Le soir, sur une route obscure.<br>
Elle y vint &mdash; folle cr&eacute;ature!<br>
Nous sommes tous plus ou moins fous!<br>
</p>

<p>
Elle &eacute;tait encore jolie,<br>
Quoique bien fatigu&eacute;e! et moi,<br>
Je l'aimais trop! voil&agrave; pourquoi<br>
Je lui dis: Sors de cette vie!<br>
</p>

<p>
Nul ne peut me comprendre. Un seul<br>
Parmi ces ivrognes stupides<br>
Songea-t-il dans ses nuits morbides<br>
&Agrave; faire du vin un linceul?<br>
</p>

<p>
Cette crapule invuln&eacute;rable<br>
Comme les machines de fer<br>
Jamais, ni l'&eacute;t&eacute; ni l'hiver,<br>
N'a connu l'amour v&eacute;ritable,<br>
</p>

<p>
Avec ses noirs enchantements,<br>
Son cort&egrave;ge infernal d'alarmes,<br>
Ses fioles de poison, ses larmes,<br>
Ses bruits de cha&icirc;ne et d'ossements!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Me voil&agrave; libre et solitaire!<br>
Je serai ce soir ivre mort;<br>
Alors, sans peur et sans remords,<br>
Je me coucherai sur la terre,<br>
</p>

<p>
Et je dormirai comme un chien!<br>
Le chariot aux lourdes roues<br>
Charg&eacute; de pierres et de boues,<br>
Le wagon enrag&eacute; peut bien<br>
</p>

<p>
Ecraser ma t&ecirc;te coupable<br>
Ou me couper par le milieu,<br>
Je m'en moque comme de Dieu,<br>
Du Diable ou de la Sainte Table!<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>The Murderer's Wine</b><br>
</p>

<p>
My wife is dead and I am free! <br>
Now I can drink my fill; <br>
When I'd come home without a sou, <br>
Her screaming would drive me crazy.<br>
</p>

<p>
I am as happy as a king;<br>
The air is pure, the sky superb...<br>
We had a summer like this<br>
When I fell in love with her!<br>
</p>

<p>
To satisfy the awful thirst <br>
That tortures me, I'd have to drink <br>
All the wine it would take to fill <br>
Her grave &mdash; that is not a little:<br>
</p>

<p>
I threw her down a well,<br>
And what is more, I dropped on her<br>
All the stones of the well's rim.<br>
I will forget her if I can!<br>
</p>

<p>
In the name of love's vows,<br>
From which nothing can release us,<br>
And to become the friends we were<br>
When we first knew passion's rapture,<br>
</p>

<p>
I begged of her a rendezvous <br>
At night, on a deserted road. <br>
She came there! &mdash; mad creature! <br>
We're all more or less mad!<br>
</p>

<p>
She was still attractive,<br>
Although very tired! and I,<br>
I loved her too much! that is why<br>
I said to her: Depart this life!<br>
</p>

<p>
None can understand me. Did one <br>
Among all those stupid drunkards <br>
Ever dream in his morbid nights <br>
Of making a shroud of wine?<br>
</p>

<p>
That dissolute crowd, unfeeling<br>
As an iron machine,<br>
Never, nor summer, nor winter,<br>
Has known what true love is,<br>
</p>

<p>
With its black enchantments,<br>
Its hellish cortege of alarms,<br>
Its phials of poison, and its tears,<br>
Its noise of chains and dead men's bones!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Here I am free and all alone!<br>
I'll get blind drunk tonight;<br>
Then without fear, without remorse,<br>
I'll lie down on the ground<br>
</p>

<p>
And I'll sleep like a dog!<br>
The dump-cart with its heavy wheels<br>
Loaded with mud and rocks,<br>
The careening wagon may well<br>
</p>

<p>
Crush in my guilty head <br>
Or cut my body in two; <br>
I laugh at God, at the Devil, <br>
And at the Holy Table as well!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Wine of the Murderer</b>
</p>

<p>
My wife is dead. I'm free. From hence <br>
I'll drink my fill, and that's the truth! <br>
Each time I came back with no pence, <br>
Her screechings drilled me like a tooth.<br>
</p>

<p>
Now I'm as happy as a king...<br>
Air pure, a cloudless sky above. <br>
I can remember such a thing <br>
The summer that we fell in love.<br>
</p>

<p>
To quench the thirst that tears my throat<br>
It would require the vats to flow<br>
Enough to set her tomb afloat &mdash; <br>
And that's no thimbleful, oh no!<br>
</p>

<p>
I threw her in a well to drown, <br>
With the walled rocks that round it stood, <br>
To keep her there, and hold her down &mdash; <br>
I would forget her if I could!<br>
</p>

<p>
Pleading our early tender vows,<br>
Which naught could break for evermore,<br>
To reconcile us, spouse to spouse,<br>
In the same raptures as before &mdash; <br>
</p>

<p>
I begged of her a rendezvous<br>
One evening in a gloomy lane.<br>
She came &mdash; a crazy thing to do!<br>
We all are more-or-less insane!<br>
</p>

<p>
She still was quite attractive, though <br>
A little tired and ill: and I <br>
Still loved her more than ever: so <br>
I said, "Get out of life, and die!"<br>
</p>

<p>
None understand me. Could a single <br>
"Drunk" of the stupid sort design, <br>
On morbid nights, by his own ingle, <br>
To make a winding sheet of wine?<br>
</p>

<p>
Of dense invulnerable stuff,<br>
Like engines built to shunt or shove,<br>
They've never known, through smooth or rough,<br>
The veritable power of love,<br>
</p>

<p>
its black enchantments, fiery trials, <br>
Processions of infernal pains, <br>
Its burning tears, its poison phials, <br>
Its rattling bones, and jingling chains.<br>
</p>

<p>
Now I am free and all alone. <br>
Tonight I'll get dead-drunk, of course. <br>
My head I'll pillow on a stone <br>
Without repentance or remorse.<br>
</p>

<p>
And there I'll sleep like any dog.<br>
The lumbering cart with massive wheels<br>
Piled up with stones, or peat, or bog,<br>
Or hurtling wagon, as it reels<br>
</p>

<p>
May crush my skull in, like a clod, <br>
Or halve me at the crossing-level. <br>
I'd care as little as for God, <br>
The Ten Commandments, or the Devil.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>

<p>
<b>The Drunkard</b><br>
</p>

<p>
My wife is dead, and I am free!<br>
Now I can drink both night and day. <br>
When I came home without my pay <br>
Her crying upset me horribly.<br>
</p>

<p>
I am as happy as a king. <br>
The air is soft. The sky is clear. <br>
Ah, what a lovely spring, this year! <br>
I courted her in such a spring.<br>
</p>

<p>
Now I can drink to drown my care<br>
As much wine as her tomb would hold &mdash; <br>
The tomb where she lies pale and cold.<br>
And that will be no small affair,<br>
</p>

<p>
For I have thrown her, body and limb,<br>
In an old well; I even threw<br>
All the loose stones around the brim<br>
On top of her. Good riddance, too!<br>
</p>

<p>
I asked her in the name of Christ,<br>
To whom our marriage vows were told,<br>
To be my sweetheart as of old &mdash; <br>
To come to a forsaken tryst<br>
</p>

<p>
We had when we were young and gay, <br>
That everything might be the same: <br>
And she, the foolish creature, came! <br>
We all have our weak moments, eh?<br>
</p>

<p>
She was attractive still, all right,<br>
Though faded. I still loved her &mdash; more<br>
Than there was rhyme or reason for.<br>
I had to end it, come what might!<br>
</p>

<p>
Nobody understands me. What's <br>
The use of wasting my good breath <br>
Explaining to these stupid sots <br>
The mysteries of love and death?<br>
</p>

<p>
They take their women by routine, <br>
These louts &mdash; the way they eat and drink. <br>
Which one has ever stopped to think <br>
What the word love might really mean?<br>
</p>

<p>
Love, with its softness in your reins, <br>
With all its nightmares, all its fears, <br>
Its cups of poison mixed with tears, <br>
Its rattling skeletons and chains.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Well, here I am, alone and free!<br>
Tonight I will be drunk for fair,<br>
And I will lay me down, I swear,<br>
Upon the highroad happily,<br>
</p>

<p>
And sleep like an old dog, be sure,<br>
Right where the heavy trucks go by,<br>
Loaded with gravel and manure.<br>
The wheel can smear my brains out &mdash; ay,<br>
</p>

<p>
Or it can break me like a clod <br>
In two, or it can mash me flat. <br>
I care about as much for that <br>
As for the long white beard of God!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; George Dillon, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>

<p>
<b>The Murderer's Wine</b><br>
</p>

<p>
My wife is dead and I am free, <br>
Now I may drink to my content; <br>
When I came back without a cent <br>
Her piteous outcries tortured me. <br>
</p>

<p>
Now I am happy as a king, <br>
The air is pure, the sky is clear; <br>
Just such a summer as that year, <br>
When first I went a-sweethearting. <br>
</p>

<p>
A horrible thirst is tearing me, <br>
To quench it I should have to swill <br>
Just as much cool wine as would fill <br>
Her tomb &mdash; that's no small quantity. <br>
</p>

<p>
I threw her down and then began <br>
To pile upon her where she fell <br>
All the great stones around the well &mdash; <br>
I shall forget it if I can. <br>
</p>

<p>
By all the soft vows of our prime, <br>
By those eternal oaths we swore, <br>
And that our love might be once more <br>
As 'twas in our old passionate time, <br>
</p>

<p>
I begged her in a lonely spot <br>
To come and meet me at nightfall; <br>
She came, mad creature &mdash; we are all <br>
More or less crazy, are we not? <br>
</p>

<p>
She was quite pretty still, my wife, <br>
Though she was very tired, and I, <br>
I loved her too much, that is why <br>
I said to her, "Come, quit this life."<br>
</p>

<p>
No one can grasp my thought aright; <br>
Did any of these sodden swine <br>
Ever conceive a shroud of wine <br>
On his most strangely morbid night? <br>
</p>

<p>
Dull and insensible above <br>
Iron machines, that stupid crew, <br>
Summer or winter, never knew <br>
The agonies of real love. <br>
</p>

<p>
So now I am without a care! <br>
Dead-drunk this evening I shall be, <br>
Then fearlessly, remorselessly <br>
Shall lie out in the open air. <br>
</p>

<p>
And sleep there like a homeless cur; <br>
Some cart may rumble with a load <br>
Of stones or mud along the road <br>
And crush my head &mdash; I shall not stir. <br>
</p>

<p>
Some heavy dray incontinent <br>
May come and cut me clean in two: <br>
I laugh at thought o't as I do <br>
At Devil, God, and Sacrament. <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jack Collings Squire, <i>Poems and Baudelaire Flowers</i> (London: The New Age Press, Ltd, 1909)<br>
