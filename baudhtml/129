<b>Le L&eacute;th&eacute;</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Viens sur mon coeur, &acirc;me cruelle et sourde,<br>
Tigre ador&eacute;, monstre aux airs indolents; <br>
Je veux longtemps plonger mes doigts tremblants <br>
Dans l'&eacute;paisseur de ta crini&egrave;re lourde;<br>
</p>

<p>
Dans tes jupons remplis de ton parfum <br>
Ensevelir ma t&ecirc;te endolorie, <br>
Et respirer, comme une fleur fl&eacute;trie, <br>
Le doux relent de mon amour d&eacute;funt.<br>
</p>

<p>
Je veux dormir! dormir plut&ocirc;t que vivre! <br>
Dans un sommeil aussi doux que la mort, <br>
J'&eacute;talerai mes baisers sans remords <br>
Sur ton beau corps poli comme le cuivre.<br>
</p>

<p>
Pour engloutir mes sanglots apais&eacute;s <br>
Rien ne me vaut l'ab&icirc;me de ta couche; <br>
L'oubli puissant habite sur ta bouche, <br>
Et le L&eacute;th&eacute; coule dans tes baisers.<br>
</p>

<p>
&Agrave; mon destin, d&eacute;sormais mon d&eacute;lice, <br>
J'ob&eacute;irai comme un pr&eacute;destin&eacute;; <br>
Martyr docile, innocent condamn&eacute;, <br>
Dont la ferveur attise le supplice,<br>
</p>

<p>
Je sucerai, pour noyer ma rancoeur, <br>
Le n&eacute;penth&egrave;s et la bonne cigu&euml; <br>
Aux bouts charmants de cette gorge aigu&euml; <br>
Qui n'a jamais emprisonn&eacute; de coeur.
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>Lethe</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Come, lie upon my breast, cruel, insensitive soul,<br>
Adored tigress, monster with the indolent air;<br>
I want to plunge trembling fingers for a long time<br>
In the thickness of your heavy mane,<br>
</p>

<p>
To bury my head, full of pain <br>
In your skirts redolent of your perfume, <br>
To inhale, as from a withered flower, <br>
The moldy sweetness of my defunct love.<br>
</p>

<p>
I wish to sleep! to sleep rather than live! <br>
In a slumber doubtful as death, <br>
I shall remorselessly cover with my kisses <br>
Your lovely body polished like copper.<br>
</p>

<p>
To bury my subdued sobbing <br>
Nothing equals the abyss of your bed, <br>
Potent oblivion dwells upon your lips <br>
And Lethe flows in your kisses.<br>
</p>

<p>
My fate, hereafter my delight, <br>
I'll obey like one predestined; <br>
Docile martyr, innocent man condemned, <br>
Whose fervor aggravates the punishment.<br>
</p>

<p>
I shall suck, to drown my rancor, <br>
Nepenthe and the good hemlock <br>
From the charming tips of those pointed breasts <br>
That have never guarded a heart.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Lethe</b>
</p>

<p>
Rest on my heart, deaf, cruel soul, adored <br>
Tigress, and monster with the lazy air. <br>
I long, in the black jungles of your hair, <br>
To force each finger thrilling like a sword:<br>
</p>

<p>
Within wide skirts, filled with your scent, to hide <br>
My bruised and battered forehead hour by hour, <br>
And breathe, like dampness from a withered flower, <br>
The pleasant mildew of a love that died.<br>
</p>

<p>
Rather than live, I wish to sleep, alas! <br>
Lulled in a slumber soft and dark as death, <br>
In ruthless kisses lavishing my breath <br>
Upon your body smooth as burnished brass.<br>
</p>

<p>
To swallow up my sorrows in eclipse, <br>
Nothing can match your couch's deep abysses; <br>
The stream of Lethe issues from your kisses <br>
And powerful oblivion from your lips.<br>
</p>

<p>
Like a predestined victim I submit: <br>
My doom, to me, henceforth, is my delight, <br>
A willing martyr in my own despite <br>
Whose fervour fans the faggots it has lit.<br>
</p>

<p>
To drown my rancour and to heal its smart, <br>
Nepenthe and sweet hemlock, peace and rest, <br>
I'll drink from the twin summits of a breast <br>
That never lodged the semblance of a heart.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Lethe</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Come to my arms, cruel and sullen thing;<br>
Indolent beast, come to my arms again,<br>
For I would plunge my fingers in your mane<br>
And be a long time unremembering &mdash; <br>
</p>

<p>
And bury myself in you, and breathe your wild <br>
Perfume remorselessly for one more hour: <br>
And breathe again, as of a ruined flower, <br>
The fragrance of the love you have defiled.<br>
</p>

<p>
I long to sleep; I think that from a stark <br>
Slumber like death I could awake the same <br>
As I was once, and lavish without shame <br>
Caresses upon your body, glowing and dark.<br>
</p>

<p>
To drown my sorrow there is no abyss, <br>
However deep, that can compare with your bed. <br>
Forgetfulness has made its country your red <br>
Mouth, and the flowing of Lethe is in your kiss.<br>
</p>

<p>
My doom, henceforward, is my sole desire:<br>
As martyrs, being demented in their zeal,<br>
Shake with delightful spasms upon the wheel,<br>
Implore the whip, or puff upon the fire,<br>
</p>

<p>
So I implore you, fervently resigned! <br>
Come; I would drink nepenthe and long rest <br>
At the sweet points of this entrancing breast <br>
Wherein no heart has ever been confined.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; George Dillon, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Lethe</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Tigress adored, indolent fiend, lie there, <br>
There on my heart now, merciless and strong, <br>
I wish to run my trembling fingers long <br>
Through the black tangles of your heavy hair, <br>
To plunge my aching head amorous of <br>
Your skirts as into secret, perfumed bowers, <br>
To breathe your scent as from pale withered flowers <br>
The after-flavor of my defunct love.<br>
</p>

<p>
I wish to sleep rather than live, alas!<br>
In slumber deep and sweet as death, O lover,<br>
As my fierce and remorseless kisses cover<br>
Your lovely body, bright as burnished brass,<br>
To bury my stilled sobs in the abysses<br>
Of your anodyne bed, to feast upon<br>
Your lips that shed potent oblivion,<br>
To drink the Lethe flowing in your kisses.<br>
</p>

<p>
I shall delight in following my fate, <br>
Obeying it gladly as a man contemned, <br>
O docile martyr, innocent condemned <br>
To tortures that his fervors aggravate. <br>
With suckling lips to quell my spleen and rancor, <br>
Nepenthe I shall drain, and hemlock's sweets, <br>
Out of the magic tips of pointed teats <br>
That never served a human heart for anchor.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jacques LeClercq, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (Mt Vernon, NY: Peter Pauper Press, 1958)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Lethe</b> <br>
</p>

<p>
Slide through my heart.<br>
Mud bank, my love is dead.<br>
I'd rather sleep than live &mdash;<br>
But how even then<br>
Fish mouths move and<br>
Voices argue,<br>
Drip, slosh, cut, heave,<br>
In the nearby kitchen.<br>
Where splendor ends.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Will Schmitz<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Le L&eacute;th&eacute;</b><br>
</p>

<p>
come to my heart, cold viper-soul malign,<br>
beloved tiger, hydra indolent;<br>
long will I drag my hands incontinent<br>
and quivering, through this vast loosed mane of thine;<br>
</p>

<p>
long will I bury throbbing brow and head<br>
among thy skirts all redolent of thee,<br>
and breathe &mdash; a blighted flower of perfidy &mdash;<br>
the fading odour of my passion dead.<br>
</p>

<p>
I'll sleep, not live! I'll lose myself in sleep!<br>
in slumber soft as Death's uncertain shore,<br>
I'll sleep and sow my drowsy kisses o'er<br>
thy polished coppery arms and bosom deep.<br>
</p>

<p>
to drown my sobs and still my spirit &mdash; o!<br>
no boon but thine abysmal bed avails;<br>
poppied oblivion from thy mouth exhales<br>
and through thy kisses floods of Lethe flow.<br>
</p>

<p>
so to my doom, henceforward my desire,<br>
I shall submit as one predestinate;<br>
and like a martyr, calm, immaculate,<br>
whose fervour prods again his flickering pyre,<br>
</p>

<p>
I'll suck, to drown my hate's eternal smart,<br>
Nepenthe, and good bitter hemlock brew,<br>
from the sharp rose-buds of thy breast, anew,<br>
thy breast that never did contain a heart.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Lewis Piaget Shanks, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (New York: Ives Washburn, 1931)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Lethe</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Come on my heart, cruel and insensible soul, <br>
My darling tiger, beast with indolent airs; <br>
I want to plunge for hours my trembling fingers <br>
In your thick and heavy mane;<br>
</p>

<p>
In your petticoats filled with your perfume <br>
To bury my aching head, <br>
And breathe, like a faded flower, <br>
The sweet taste of my dead love.<br>
</p>

<p>
I want to sleep, to sleep and not to live, <br>
In a sleep as soft as death, <br>
I shall cover with remorseless kisses <br>
Your body beautifully polished as copper.<br>
</p>

<p>
To swallow my appeased sobbing <br>
I need only the abyss of your bed; <br>
A powerful oblivion lives on your lips, <br>
And all Lethe flows in your kisses.<br>
</p>

<p>
I shall obey, as though predestined,<br>
My destiny, that is now my delight;<br>
Submissive martyr, innocent damned one,<br>
My ardor inflames my torture,<br>
</p>

<p>
And I shall suck, to drown my bitterness <br>
The nepenthe and the good hemlock, <br>
On the lovely tips of those jutting breasts <br>
Which have never imprisoned love.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Geoffrey Wagner, <i>Selected Poems of Charles Baudelaire</i> (NY: Grove Press, 1974) <br>

Two editions of <i>Fleurs du mal</i> were published in Baudelaire's lifetime &mdash; one in 1857 and an expanded edition in 1861. "Scraps" and censored poems were collected in <i>Les &Eacute;paves</i> in 1866. After Baudelaire died the following year, a "definitive" edition appeared in 1868.
