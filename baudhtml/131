<b>Remords posthume</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Lorsque tu dormiras, ma belle t&eacute;n&eacute;breuse,<br>
Au fond d'un monument construit en marbre noir,<br>
Et lorsque tu n'auras pour alc&ocirc;ve et manoir<br>
Qu'un caveau pluvieux et qu'une fosse creuse;<br>
</p>

<p>
Quand la pierre, opprimant ta poitrine peureuse<br>
Et tes flancs qu'assouplit un charmant nonchaloir,<br>
Emp&ecirc;chera ton coeur de battre et de vouloir,<br>
Et tes pieds de courir leur course aventureuse,<br>
</p>

<p>
Le tombeau, confident de mon r&ecirc;ve infini<br>
(Car le tombeau toujours comprendra le po&egrave;te),<br>
Durant ces grandes nuits d'o&ugrave; le somme est banni,<br>
</p>

<p>
Te dira: &laquo;Que vous sert, courtisane imparfaite,<br>
De n'avoir pas connu ce que pleurent les morts?&raquo;<br>
&mdash; Et le ver rongera ta peau comme un remords.<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>Posthumous Remorse</b><br>
</p>

<p>
When you will sleep, O dusky beauty mine,<br>
Beneath a monument fashioned of black marble,<br>
When you will have for bedroom and mansion<br>
Only a rain-swept vault and a hollow grave,<br>
</p>

<p>
When the slab of stone, oppressing your frightened breast<br>
And your flanks now supple with charming nonchalance,<br>
Will keep your heart from beating, from wishing,<br>
And your feet from running their adventurous course,<br>
</p>

<p>
The tomb, confidant of my infinite dreams <br>
(For the tomb will always understand the poet) <br>
Through those long nights from which all sleep is banned, will say:<br>
</p>

<p>
"What does it profit you, imperfect courtesan, <br>
Not to have known why the dead weep?"<br>
&mdash; And like remorse the worm will gnaw your skin.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Posthumous Remorse</b>
</p>

<p>
When you're asleep, dear shadow-coloured wench, <br>
Within a coal-black, marble monument: <br>
When, for your room and mansion, you are pent <br>
In a wet cellar and a hollow trench:<br>
</p>

<p>
When the stone, pressing on your startled breast <br>
And flanks in fluent suppleness competing, <br>
Prevents your heart from wishing or from beating, <br>
Your feet from racing on their reckless quest.<br>
</p>

<p>
The tomb that shares my deathless recollection<br>
(For poets best are understood by tombs)<br>
On those long nights, when never sleep presumes,<br>
</p>

<p>
Will say, "What boots, frail vase of imperfection,<br>
Not to have known what pains with death begin?" &mdash; <br>
And, like remorse, the worm will gnaw your skin.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>


<p>
<b>Posthumous Remorse</b><br>
</p>

<p>
When, O sweet dusky beauty, you shall rest<br>
Deep under a bleak marble monument,<br>
When for last manor yours the tenement<br>
Of rainswept vault or hollow ditch at best,<br>
When the long stone weighs down your frightened breast<br>
And flanks &mdash; so supple now and indolent &mdash; <br>
Choking your heart's beat and your feet's intent<br>
To race again on their adventurous quest,<br>
</p>

<p>
The tomb, confidant of my endless dreams, shall keep<br>
Vigil through those long nights that know not sleep,<br>
(Poet and tomb were friends since Time began)<br>
Saying: &quot;What use, imperfect courtesan,<br>
Not to make known what dead men mourn perforce?&quot;<br>
While the worm gnaws you sharply as remorse.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jacques LeClercq, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (Mt Vernon, NY: Peter Pauper Press, 1958)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Remorse Too Late</b><br>
</p>

<p>
My dark and lovely thing, when you at length lie dead, <br>
And sleep beneath a slab of marble black as pitch; <br>
And have, for perfumed alcove and seductive bed, <br>
Only a rainy cavern and a hollow ditch;<br>
</p>

<p>
When the oppressive stone upon your frightened breast <br>
Lets settle all its weight, and on your supple thighs; <br>
Restrains your heart from beating, flattens it to rest; <br>
Bends down and binds your feet, so roving, so unwise;<br>
</p>

<p>
The tomb, that knows me well and reads my dream aright,<br>
(What poet but confides his secret to the tomb?)<br>
Will say to you some day during that endless night,<br>
</p>

<p>
"They fare but ill, vain courtesan, in this cold room, <br>
Who bring here no warm memories of true love to keep!"<br>
&mdash; And like remorse the worm will gnaw you in your sleep.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Edna St. Vincent Millay, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Posthumous Remorse</b>
</p>

<p>
Ah, when thou shalt slumber, my darkling love, <br>
Beneath a black marble-made statuette, <br>
And when thou'lt have nought for thy house or alcove, <br>
But a cavernous den and a damp oubliette. <br>
</p>

<p>
When the tomb-stone, oppressing thy timorous breast, <br>
And thy hips drooping sweetly with listless decay, <br>
The pulse and desires of mine heart shall arrest, <br>
And thy feet from pursuing their adventurous way, <br>
</p>

<p>
Then the grave, that dark friend of my limitless dreams <br>
(For the grave ever readeth the poet aright), <br>
Amid those long nights, which no slumber redeems <br>
</p>

<p>
'Twill query &mdash; "What use to thee, incomplete spright <br>
That thou ne'er hast unfathomed the tears of the dead"? &mdash;<br>
Then the worms will gnaw deep at thy body, like Dread. <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Cyril Scott, <i>Baudelaire: The Flowers of Evil</i> (London: Elkin Mathews, 1909)
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Remords posthume</b><br>
</p>

<p>
when thou wilt sleep, dark girl of shadowy gaze,<br>
down in the cold black marble of a tomb,<br>
a dripping vault thine only tiring-room,<br>
thine only bed a grave where all decays,<br>
</p>

<p>
when rock shall press thy paling breast and graze<br>
thy limbs now languorous-lovely in the gloom<br>
&mdash; shall crush thy faltering heart, thy will consume<br>
and halt thy feet in their adventurous ways,<br>
</p>

<p>
the Grave, that knows what infinite dreams I keep,<br>
(o Grave, the poet's friend forever, thou!)<br>
all through the night bereft of exiled sleep,<br>
</p>

<p>
shall ask: "art sorry, wretched wanton, now,<br>
not to have learned why dead men weep, perforce?"<br>
&mdash; and worms shall gnaw thy breast like sharp remorse.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Lewis Piaget Shanks, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (New York: Ives Washburn, 1931)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Remorse of the Dead</b>
</p>

<p>
O shadowy Beauty mine, when thou shalt sleep<br>
In the deep heart of a black marble tomb;<br>
When thou for mansion and for bower shalt keep<br>
Only one rainy cave of hollow gloom;<br>
</p>

<p>
And when the stone upon thy trembling breast,<br>
And on thy straight sweet body's supple grace,<br>
Crushes thy will and keeps thy heart at rest,<br>
And holds those feet from their adventurous race;<br>
</p>

<p>
Then the deep grave, who shares my reverie,<br>
(For the deep grave is aye the poet's friend)<br>
During long nights when sleep is far from thee,<br>
</p>

<p>
Shall whisper: "Ah, thou didst not comprehend<br>
The dead wept thus, thou woman frail and weak" &mdash; <br>
And like remorse the worm shall gnaw thy cheek.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; F.P. Sturm, from <i>Baudelaire: His Prose and Poetry</i>, edited by Thomas Robert Smith (New York: Boni and Liveright, 1919)

Two editions of <i>Fleurs du mal</i> were published in Baudelaire's lifetime &mdash; one in 1857 and an expanded edition in 1861. "Scraps" and censored poems were collected in <i>Les &Eacute;paves</i> in 1866. After Baudelaire died the following year, a "definitive" edition appeared in 1868.
