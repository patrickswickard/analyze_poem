<p>
La Nature est un temple o&ugrave; de vivants piliers<br>
Laissent parfois sortir de confuses paroles;<br>
L'homme y passe &agrave; travers des for&ecirc;ts de symboles<br>
Qui l'observent avec des regards familiers.<br>
</p>

<p>
Comme de longs &eacute;chos qui de loin se confondent<br>
Dans une t&eacute;n&eacute;breuse et profonde unit&eacute;,<br>
Vaste comme la nuit et comme la clart&eacute;,<br>
Les parfums, les couleurs et les sons se r&eacute;pondent.<br>
</p>

<p>
II est des parfums frais comme des chairs d'enfants,<br>
Doux comme les hautbois, verts comme les prairies,<br>
&mdash; Et d'autres, corrompus, riches et triomphants,<br>
</p>

<p>
Ayant l'expansion des choses infinies,<br>
Comme l'ambre, le musc, le benjoin et l'encens,<br>
Qui chantent les transports de l'esprit et des sens.<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>Correspondences</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Nature is a temple in which living pillars <br>
Sometimes give voice to confused words; <br>
Man passes there through forests of symbols <br>
Which look at him with understanding eyes.<br>
</p>

<p>
Like prolonged echoes mingling in the distance <br>
In a deep and tenebrous unity, <br>
Vast as the dark of night and as the light of day, <br>
Perfumes, sounds, and colors correspond.<br>
</p>

<p>
There are perfumes as cool as the flesh of children,<br>
Sweet as oboes, green as meadows<br>
&mdash; And others are corrupt, and rich, triumphant,<br>
</p>

<p>
With power to expand into infinity,<br>
Like amber and incense, musk, benzoin, <br>
That sing the ecstasy of the soul and senses.<br>
</p>

<p>
Nature's a temple where each living column, <br>
At times, gives forth vague words. There Man advances <br>
Through forest-groves of symbols, strange and solemn, <br>
Who follow him with their familiar glances.<br>
</p>

<p>
As long-drawn echoes mingle and transfuse <br>
Till in a deep, dark unison they swoon, <br>
Vast as the night or as the vault of noon &mdash; <br>
So are commingled perfumes, sounds, and hues.<br>
</p>

<p>
There can be perfumes cool as children's flesh,<br>
Like fiddIes, sweet, like meadows greenly fresh.<br>
Rich, complex, and triumphant, others roll<br>
</p>

<p>
With the vast range of all non-finite things &mdash; <br>
Amber, musk, incense, benjamin, each sings <br>
The transports of the senses and the soul.<br>
</p>

<p>
All nature is one temple, the living aisles whereof <br>
Murmur in a soft language, half strange, half understood; <br>
Man wanders there as through a cabalistic wood, <br>
Aware of eyes that watch him in the leaves above.<br>
</p>

<p>
Like voices echoing in his senses from beyond<br>
Life's watery source, and which into one voice unite, <br>
Vast as the turning planet clothed in darkness and light, <br>
So do all sounds and hues and fragrances correspond.<br>
</p>

<p>
Perfumes there are as sweet as the music of pipes and strings,<br>
As pure as the naked flesh of children, as full of peace<br>
As wide green prairies &mdash; and there are others, having the whole<br>
</p>

<p>
Corrupt proud all-pervasiveness of infinite things, <br>
Like frankincense, and musk, and myrrh, and ambergris, <br>
That cry of the ecstasy of the body and of the soul.<br>
</p>

Nature is a temple where living pillars<br>
At times allow confused words to come forth;<br>
There man passes through forests of symbols<br>
Which observe him with familiar eyes.<br>
</p>

<p>
Like long echoes which in a distance are mingled<br>
In a dark and profound unison<br>
Vast as night is and light,<br>
Perfumes, colors and sounds answer one another.<br>

<p>
There are perfumes as cool as the flesh of children,<br>

<b>Correspondences</b><br>
</p>

<p>
In Nature's temple, living pillars rise, <br>
Speaking sometimes in words of abstruse sense; <br>
Man walks through woods of symbols, dark and dense, <br>
Which gaze at him with fond familiar eyes. <br>
Like distant echoes blent in the beyond <br>
In unity, in a deep darksome way, <br>
Vast as black night and vast as splendent day, <br>
Perfumes and sounds and colors correspond.<br>
</p>

<p>
Some scents are cool as children's flesh is cool, <br>
Sweet as are oboes, green as meadowlands, <br>
And others rich, corrupt, triumphant, full, <br>
Expanding as infinity expands: <br>
Benzoin or musk or amber that incenses, <br>
Hymning the ecstasy of soul and senses.<br>
</p>

<p>
<b>Echoes</b> <br>
</p>

<p>
In Nature's temple, living columns rise, <br>
Which oftentimes give tongue to words subdued, <br>
And Man traverses this symbolic wood, <br>
Which looks at him with half familiar eyes,<br>
</p>

<p>
Like lingering echoes, which afar confound <br>
Themselves in deep and sombre unity, <br>
As vast as Night, and like transplendency, <br>
The scents and colours to each other respond. <br>
</p>

<p>
And scents there are, like infant's flesh as chaste, <br>
As sweet as oboes, and as meadows fair, <br>
And others, proud, corrupted, rich and vast, <br>
</p>

<p>
Which have the expansion of infinity, <br>
Like amber, musk and frankincense and myrrh, <br>
That sing the soul's and senses' ecstasy. <br>

<p>
Nature's a fane where down each corridor<br>
of living pillars, darkling whispers roll,<br>
&mdash; a symbol-forest every pilgrim soul<br>
must pierce, 'neath gazing eyes it knew before.<br>
</p>

<p>
like echoes long that from afar rebound,<br>
merged till one deep low shadowy note is born,<br>
vast as the night or as the fires of morn,<br>
sound calls to fragrance, colour calls to sound.<br>
</p>

<p>
cool as an infant's brow some perfumes are,<br>
softer than oboes, green as rainy leas;<br>
others, corrupt, exultant, rich, unbar<br>
</p>

<p>
wide infinities wherein we move at ease:<br>
&mdash; musk, ambergris, frankincense, benjamin<br>
chant all our soul or sense can revel in.<br>

<b>Correspondences</b>
</p>

<p>
In Nature's temple living pillars rise,<br>
And words are murmured none have understood,<br>
And man must wander through a tangled wood<br>
Of symbols watching him with friendly eyes.<br>
</p>

<p>
As long-drawn echoes heard far-off and dim<br>
Mingle to one deep sound and fade away;<br>
Vast as the night and brilliant as the day,<br>
Colour and sound and perfume speak to him.<br>
</p>

<p>
Some perfumes are as fragrant as a child,<br>
Sweet as the sound of hautboys, meadow-green;<br>
Others, corrupted, rich, exultant, wild,<br>
</p>

<p>
Have all the expansion of things infinite:<br>
As amber, incense, musk, and benzoin,<br>
Which sing the sense's and the soul's delight.<br>
</p>

<p>
Nature is a temple where living pillars <br>
Let sometimes emerge confused words; <br>
Man crosses it through forests of symbols <br>
Which watch him with intimate eyes.<br>
</p>

<p>
Like those deep echoes that meet from afar <br>
In a dark and profound harmony, <br>
As vast as night and clarity, <br>
So perfumes, colors, tones answer each other.<br>
</p>

<p>
There are perfumes fresh as children's flesh,<br>
Soft as oboes, green as meadows,<br>
And others, corrupted, rich, triumphant,<br>
</p>

<p>
Possessing the diffusion of infinite things, <br>
Like amber, musk, incense and aromatic resin, <br>
Chanting the ecstasies of spirit and senses.<br>
</p>

Two editions of <i>Fleurs du mal</i> were published in Baudelaire's lifetime &mdash; one in 1857 and an expanded edition in 1861. "Scraps" and censored poems were collected in <i>Les &Eacute;paves</i> in 1866. After Baudelaire died the following year, a "definitive" edition appeared in 1868.
