<b>Tout enti&egrave;re</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Le D&eacute;mon, dans ma chambre haute<br>
Ce matin est venu me voir,<br>
Et, t&acirc;chant &agrave; me prendre en faute<br>
Me dit: &laquo;Je voudrais bien savoir<br>
</p>

<p>
Parmi toutes les belles choses<br>
Dont est fait son enchantement,<br>
Parmi les objets noirs ou roses<br>
Qui composent son corps charmant,<br>
</p>

<p>
Quel est le plus doux.&raquo; &mdash; &Ocirc; mon &acirc;me!<br>
Tu r&eacute;pondis &agrave; l'Abhorr&eacute;:<br>
&laquo;Puisqu'en Elle tout est dictame<br>
Rien ne peut &ecirc;tre pr&eacute;f&eacute;r&eacute;.<br>
</p>

<p>
Lorsque tout me ravit, j'ignore<br>
Si quelque chose me s&eacute;duit.<br>
Elle &eacute;blouit comme l'Aurore<br>
Et console comme la Nuit;<br>
</p>

<p>
Et l'harmonie est trop exquise,<br>
Qui gouverne tout son beau corps,<br>
Pour que l'impuissante analyse<br>
En note les nombreux accords.<br>
</p>

<p>
&Ocirc; m&eacute;tamorphose mystique<br>
De tous mes sens fondus en un!<br>
Son haleine fait la musique,<br>
Comme sa voix fait le parfum!&raquo;<br>
</p><p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>All of Her</b><br>
</p>

<p>
The Devil into my high room<br>
This morning came to pay a call,<br>
And trying to find me in fault<br>
Said: "I should like to know,<br>
</p>

<p>
Among all the beautiful things<br>
Which make her an enchantress,<br>
Among the objects black or rose<br>
That compose her charming body,<br>
</p>

<p>
Which is the sweetest." &mdash; O my soul! <br>
You answered the loathsome Creature: <br>
"Since in Her all is dittany, <br>
No single thing can be preferred.<br>
</p>

<p>
When all delights me, I don't know <br>
If some one thing entrances me. <br>
She dazzles like the Dawn <br>
And consoles like the Night;<br>
</p>

<p>
And the harmony that governs <br>
Her whole body is too lovely <br>
For impotent analysis <br>
To note its numerous accords.<br>
</p>

<p>
O mystic metamorphosis <br>
Of all my senses joined in one! <br>
Her breath makes music, <br>
And her voice makes perfume!"<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>All in One</b>
</p>

<p>
The Demon called on me this morning, <br>
In my high room. As is his way, <br>
Thinking to catch me without warning, <br>
He put this question: "Tell me, pray,<br>
</p>

<p>
Of all the beauties that compose,<br>
The strange enchantment of her ways,<br>
Amongst the wonders black or rose,<br>
Which object most excites your praise,<br>
</p>

<p>
And is the climax in her litany?" <br>
My soul, you answered the Abhorred, <br>
"Since she is fashioned, all, of dittany, <br>
No part is most to be adored.<br>
</p>

<p>
Since I am ravished, I ignore a <br>
Degree of difference in delight. <br>
She dazzles me like the aurora <br>
And she consoles me like the night.<br>
</p>

<p>
The harmony's so exquisite <br>
That governs her, it is in vain <br>
Analysis would try to split <br>
The unity of such a strain.<br>
</p>

<p>
O mystic fusion that, enwreathing <br>
My senses, fuses each in each, <br>
To hear the music of her breathing <br>
And breathe the perfume of her speech."<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>


<p>
<b>All, All</b><br>
</p>

<p>
The Devil up my attic stair<br>
Came tiptoeing a while ago<br>
And, trying to catch me unaware,<br>
Said laughing, "I should like to know,<br>
</p>

<p>
"Of all her many charms, what springs<br>
Most often to your mind? Of all<br>
The rose-colored and shadowy things<br>
Whereby her beauty may enthrall,<br>
</p>

<p>
"Which is the sweetest?" &mdash; O my soul, <br>
You answered the abhorr&egrave;d Guest: <br>
"Her beauty is complete and whole. <br>
No single part is loveliest.<br>
</p>

<p>
"When she is near, I cannot say <br>
What gives me such intense delight. <br>
She dazzles like the break of day, <br>
She comforts like the fall of night.<br>
</p>

<p>
"My senses seem to merge in one; <br>
The harmony that rules her being <br>
Is all my knowledge &mdash; I have none <br>
Of hearing, smelling, touching, seeing.<br>
</p>

<p>
"No, no. I cannot make a choice<br>
In this sublime bewilderment.<br>
Perhaps the music of her scent!<br>
Perhaps the perfume of her voice!"<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; George Dillon, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>All Entire</b>
</p>

<p>
The Demon, in my lofty vault, <br>
This morning came to visit me, <br>
And striving me to find at fault, <br>
He said, "Fain would I know of thee;<br>
</p>

<p>
"Among the many beauteous things, <br>
&mdash; All which <i>her</i> subtle grace proclaim &mdash;<br>
Among the dark and rosy things, <br>
Which go to make her charming frame, <br>
</p>

<p>
"Which is the sweetest unto thee"? <br>
My soul! to Him thou didst retort &mdash;<br>
"Since all with her is destiny, <br>
Of preference there can be nought. <br>
</p>

<p>
When all transports me with delight, <br>
If aught deludes I can not know, <br>
She either lulls one like the Night, <br>
Or dazzles like the Morning-glow. <br>
</p>

<p>
That harmony is too divine, <br>
Which governs all her body fair, <br>
For powerless mortals to define <br>
In notes the many concords there. <br>
</p>

<p>
O mystic metamorphosis <br>
Of all my senses blent in one! <br>
Her voice a beauteous perfume is, <br>
Her breath makes music, chaste and wan. <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Cyril Scott, <i>Baudelaire: The Flowers of Evil</i> (London: Elkin Mathews, 1909)
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Tout enti&egrave;re</b><br>
</p>

<p>
this morning, to my chamber bare<br>
and high, the Devil came to call,<br>
and fain to trap me in a snare,<br>
inquired: "I would know, of all<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; of all the beauties that compose<br>
her spell profound, her subtle sway,<br>
&mdash; of all the bits of black or rose<br>
that form her lovely body, say<br>
</p>

<p>
which is the sweetest?" &mdash; o my soul,<br>
thou didst reply to the Abhorred:<br>
naught can be taken from the whole<br>
for every part is a perfect chord.<br>
</p>

<p>
when all to me is ravishing,<br>
I know not which gives most delight.<br>
like dawn she is a dazzling thing,<br>
yet she consoles me like the night;<br>
</p>

<p>
too exquisite the harmonies<br>
that all her lovely flesh affords,<br>
for my poor mind to analyse<br>
and note its many rhythmic chords.<br>
</p>

<p>
o mystic interchange, whereby<br>
my senses all are blent in one!<br>
her breath is like a lullaby<br>
and through her voice rich perfumes run!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Lewis Piaget Shanks, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (New York: Ives Washburn, 1931)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Tout Enti&egrave;re</b><br>
</p>

<p>
This morning in my attic high <br>
The Demon came to visit me, <br>
And seeking faults in my reply, <br>
He said: "I would inquire of thee, <br>
</p>

<p>
"Of all the beauties which compose <br>
Her charming body's potent spell, <br>
Of all the objects black and rose <br>
Which make the thing you love so well, <br>
</p>

<p>
"Which is the sweetest?" O my soul! <br>
Thou didst rejoin: "How tell of parts, <br>
When all I know is that the whole <br>
Works magic in my heart of hearts? <br>
</p>

<p>
"Where all is fair, how should I say <br>
What single grace is my delight? <br>
She shines on me like break of day <br>
And she consoles me as the night. <br>
</p>

<p>
"There flows through all her perfect frame <br>
A harmony too exquisite <br>
That weak analysis should name <br>
The numberless accords of it. <br>
</p>

<p>
"O mystic metamorphosis! <br>
My separate senses all are blent; <br>
Within her breath soft music is, <br>
And in her voice a subtle scent!"<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jack Collings Squire, <i>Poems and Baudelaire Flowers</i> (London: The New Age Press, Ltd, 1909)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Temptation</b>
</p>

<p>
The Demon, in my chamber high,<br>
This morning came to visit me,<br>
And, thinking he would find some fault,<br>
He whispered: "I would know of thee<br>
</p>

<p>
Among the many lovely things<br>
That make the magic of her face,<br>
Among the beauties, black and rose,<br>
That make her body's charm and grace,<br>
</p>

<p>
Which is most fair?" Thou didst reply<br>
To the Abhorred, O soul of mine:<br>
"No single beauty is the best<br>
When she is all one flower divine.<br>
</p>

<p>
When all things charm me I ignore<br>
Which one alone brings most delight;<br>
She shines before me like the dawn,<br>
And she consoles me like the night.<br>
</p>

<p>
The harmony is far too great,<br>
That governs all her body fair.<br>
For impotence to analyse<br>
And say which note is sweetest there.<br>
</p>

<p>
O mystic metamorphosis!<br>
My senses into one sense flow &mdash; <br>
Her voice makes perfume when she speaks,<br>
Her breath is music faint and low!"<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; F.P. Sturm, from <i>Baudelaire: His Prose and Poetry</i>, edited by Thomas Robert Smith (New York: Boni and Liveright, 1919)
