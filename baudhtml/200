<b>L'Albatros</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Souvent, pour s'amuser, les hommes d'&eacute;quipage<br>
Prennent des albatros, vastes oiseaux des mers,<br>
Qui suivent, indolents compagnons de voyage,<br>
Le navire glissant sur les gouffres amers.<br>
</p>

<p>
&Agrave; peine les ont-ils d&eacute;pos&eacute;s sur les planches,<br>
Que ces rois de l'azur, maladroits et honteux,<br>
Laissent piteusement leurs grandes ailes blanches<br>
Comme des avirons tra&icirc;ner &agrave; c&ocirc;t&eacute; d'eux.<br>
</p>

<p>
Ce voyageur ail&eacute;, comme il est gauche et veule!<br>
Lui, nagu&egrave;re si beau, qu'il est comique et laid!<br>
L'un agace son bec avec un br&ucirc;le-gueule,<br>
L'autre mime, en boitant, l'infirme qui volait!<br>
</p>

<p>
Le Po&egrave;te est semblable au prince des nu&eacute;es<br>
Qui hante la temp&ecirc;te et se rit de l'archer;<br>
Exil&eacute; sur le sol au milieu des hu&eacute;es,<br>
Ses ailes de g&eacute;ant l'emp&ecirc;chent de marcher.<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>The Albatross</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Often, to amuse themselves, the men of a crew <br>
Catch albatrosses, those vast sea birds <br>
That indolently follow a ship <br>
As it glides over the deep, briny sea.<br>
</p>

<p>
Scarcely have they placed them on the deck <br>
Than these kings of the sky, clumsy, ashamed, <br>
Pathetically let their great white wings <br>
Drag beside them like oars.<br>
</p>

<p>
That winged voyager, how weak and gauche he is, <br>
So beautiful before, now comic and ugly! <br>
One man worries his beak with a stubby clay pipe; <br>
Another limps, mimics the cripple who once flew!<br>
</p>

<p>
The poet resembles this prince of cloud and sky <br>
Who frequents the tempest and laughs at the bowman; <br>
When exiled on the earth, the butt of hoots and jeers, <br>
His giant wings prevent him from walking.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Albatross</b>
</p>

<p>
Sometimes for sport the men of loafing crews <br>
Snare the great albatrosses of the deep, <br>
The indolent companions of their cruise <br>
As through the bitter vastitudes they sweep.<br>
</p>

<p>
Scarce have they fished aboard these airy kings <br>
When helpless on such unaccustomed floors, <br>
They piteously droop their huge white wings <br>
And trail them at their sides like drifting oars.<br>
</p>

<p>
How comical, how ugly, and how meek <br>
Appears this soarer of celestial snows! <br>
One, with his pipe, teases the golden beak, <br>
One, limping, mocks the cripple as he goes.<br>
</p>

<p>
The Poet, like this monarch of the clouds, <br>
Despising archers, rides the storm elate. <br>
But, stranded on the earth to jeering crowds, <br>
The great wings of the giant baulk his gait.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Albatross</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, to entertain themselves, the men of the crew <br>
Lure upon deck an unlucky albatross, one of those vast <br>
Birds of the sea that follow unwearied the voyage through, <br>
Flying in slow and elegant circles above the mast.<br>
</p>

<p>
No sooner have they disentangled him from their nets <br>
Than this aerial colossus, shorn of his pride, <br>
Goes hobbling pitiably across the planks and lets <br>
His great wings hang like heavy, useless oars at his side.<br>
</p>

<p>
How droll is the poor floundering creature, how limp and weak &mdash; <br>
He, but a moment past so lordly, flying in state! <br>
They tease him: One of them tries to stick a pipe in his beak; <br>
Another mimics with laughter his odd lurching gait.<br>
</p>

<p>
The Poet is like that wild inheritor of the cloud, <br>
A rider of storms, above the range of arrows and slings; <br>
Exiled on earth, at bay amid the jeering crowd, <br>
He cannot walk for his unmanageable wings.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; George Dillon, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Albatross</b>
</p>

<p>
Often, as an amusement, crewmen<br>
Catch albatrosses, huge birds of the sea,<br>
Who follow, indolent companions of the voyage,<br>
The ship gliding over the salty deeps.<br>
</p>

<p>
As soon as they have placed them on the deck,<br>
These kings of the sky, awkward and ashamed,<br>
Pitiably let their large white wings<br>
Drag at their sides like oars.<br>
</p>

<p>
This winged voyager, how gauche and weak he is!<br>
Once so handsome, how comic and ugly he is!<br>
One sailor irritates his beak with a pipestem,<br>
Another mimes, as he limps, the invalid who once flew!<br>
</p>

<p>
The Poet is like the prince of the clouds,<br>
Who haunts the tempest and mocks the archer;<br>
Exiled on the earth in the midst of derision,<br>
His giant wings keep him from walking.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Wallace Fowlie, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (New York: Dover Publications, 1964)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Albatrosses</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Often our sailors, for an hour of fun,<br>
Catch albatrosses on the after breeze<br>
Through which these trail the ship from sun to sun<br>
As it skims down the deep and briny seas.<br>
</p>

<p>
Scarce have these birds been set upon the poop,<br>
Than, awkward now, they, the sky's emperors,<br>
Piteous and shamed, let their great white wings droop<br>
Beside them like a pair of idle oars.<br>
</p>

<p>
These wing&egrave;d voyagers, how gauche their gait!<br>
Once noble, now how ludicrous to view!<br>
One sailor bums them with his pipe, his mate<br>
Limps, mimicking these cripples who once flew.<br>
</p>

<p>
Poets are like these lords of sky and cloud,<br>
Who ride the storm and mock the bow's taut strings,<br>
Exiled on earth amid a jeering crowd,<br>
Prisoned and palsied by their giant wings.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jacques LeClercq, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (Mt Vernon, NY: Peter Pauper Press, 1958)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Albatross</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Often, to amuse themselves, the men of the crew <br>
Catch those great birds of the seas, the albatrosses, <br>
lazy companions of the voyage, who follow <br>
The ship that slips through bitter gulfs.<br>
</p>

<p>
Hardly have they put them on the deck, <br>
Than these kings of the skies, awkward and ashamed, <br>
Piteously let their great white wings <br>
Draggle like oars beside them.<br>
</p>

<p>
This winged traveler, how weak he becomes and slack! <br>
He who of late was so beautiful, how comical and ugly! <br>
Someone teases his beak with a branding iron, <br>
Another mimics, limping, the crippled flyer!<br>
</p>

<p>
The Poet is like the prince of the clouds, <br>
Haunting the tempest and laughing at the archer; <br>
Exiled on earth amongst the shouting people, <br>
His giant's wings hinder him from walking.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Geoffrey Wagner, <i>Selected Poems of Charles Baudelaire</i> (NY: Grove Press, 1974) <br>

Two editions of <i>Fleurs du mal</i> were published in Baudelaire's lifetime &mdash; one in 1857 and an expanded edition in 1861. "Scraps" and censored poems were collected in <i>Les &Eacute;paves</i> in 1866. After Baudelaire died the following year, a "definitive" edition appeared in 1868.
