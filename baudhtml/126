<b>Une Charogne</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Rappelez-vous l'objet que nous v&icirc;mes, mon &acirc;me,<br>
Ce beau matin d'&eacute;t&eacute; si doux:<br>
Au d&eacute;tour d'un sentier une charogne inf&acirc;me<br>
Sur un lit sem&eacute; de cailloux,<br>
</p>

<p>
Les jambes en l'air, comme une femme lubrique,<br>
Br&ucirc;lante et suant les poisons,<br>
Ouvrait d'une fa&ccedil;on nonchalante et cynique<br>
Son ventre plein d'exhalaisons.<br>
</p>

<p>
Le soleil rayonnait sur cette pourriture,<br>
Comme afin de la cuire &agrave; point,<br>
Et de rendre au centuple &agrave; la grande Nature<br>
Tout ce qu'ensemble elle avait joint;<br>
</p>

<p>
Et le ciel regardait la carcasse superbe<br>
Comme une fleur s'&eacute;panouir.<br>
La puanteur &eacute;tait si forte, que sur l'herbe<br>
Vous cr&ucirc;tes vous &eacute;vanouir.<br>
</p>

<p>
Les mouches bourdonnaient sur ce ventre putride,<br>
D'o&ugrave; sortaient de noirs bataillons<br>
De larves, qui coulaient comme un &eacute;pais liquide<br>
Le long de ces vivants haillons.<br>
</p>

<p>
Tout cela descendait, montait comme une vague<br>
Ou s'&eacute;lan&ccedil;ait en p&eacute;tillant;<br>
On e&ucirc;t dit que le corps, enfl&eacute; d'un souffle vague,<br>
Vivait en se multipliant.<br>
</p>

<p>
Et ce monde rendait une &eacute;trange musique,<br>
Comme l'eau courante et le vent,<br>
Ou le grain qu'un vanneur d'un mouvement rythmique<br>
Agite et tourne dans son van.<br>
</p>

<p>
Les formes s'effa&ccedil;aient et n'&eacute;taient plus qu'un r&ecirc;ve,<br>
Une &eacute;bauche lente &agrave; venir<br>
Sur la toile oubli&eacute;e, et que l'artiste ach&egrave;ve<br>
Seulement par le souvenir.<br>
</p>

<p>
Derri&egrave;re les rochers une chienne inqui&egrave;te<br>
Nous regardait d'un oeil f&acirc;ch&eacute;, <br>
Epiant le moment de reprendre au squelette<br>
Le morceau qu'elle avait l&acirc;ch&eacute;.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Et pourtant vous serez semblable &agrave; cette ordure,<br>
&Agrave; cette horrible infection, <br>
Etoile de mes yeux, soleil de ma nature,<br>
Vous, mon ange et ma passion!<br>
</p>

<p>
Oui! telle vous serez, &ocirc; la reine des gr&acirc;ces,<br>
Apres les derniers sacrements,<br>
Quand vous irez, sous l'herbe et les floraisons grasses,<br>
Moisir parmi les ossements.<br>
</p>

<p>
Alors, &ocirc; ma beaut&eacute;! dites &agrave; la vermine<br>
Qui vous mangera de baisers,<br>
Que j'ai gard&eacute; la forme et l'essence divine<br>
De mes amours d&eacute;compos&eacute;s!<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>A Carcass</b>
</p>

<p>
My love, do you recall the object which we saw, <br>
That fair, sweet, summer morn!<br>
At a turn in the path a foul carcass<br>
On a gravel strewn bed,<br>
</p>

<p>
Its legs raised in the air, like a lustful woman, <br>
Burning and dripping with poisons,<br>
Displayed in a shameless, nonchalant way <br>
Its belly, swollen with gases.<br>
</p>

<p>
The sun shone down upon that putrescence, <br>
As if to roast it to a turn,<br>
And to give back a hundredfold to great Nature <br>
The elements she had combined;<br>
</p>

<p>
And the sky was watching that superb cadaver <br>
Blossom like a flower.<br>
So frightful was the stench that you believed <br>
You'd faint away upon the grass.<br>
</p>

<p>
The blow-flies were buzzing round that putrid belly,<br>
From which came forth black battalions<br>
Of maggots, which oozed out like a heavy liquid <br>
All along those living tatters.<br>
</p>

<p>
All this was descending and rising like a wave, <br>
Or poured out with a crackling sound;<br>
One would have said the body, swollen with a vague breath, <br>
Lived by multiplication.<br>
</p>

<p>
And this world gave forth singular music, <br>
Like running water or the wind,<br>
Or the grain that winnowers with a rhythmic motion <br>
Shake in their winnowing baskets.<br>
</p>

<p>
The forms disappeared and were no more than a dream, <br>
A sketch that slowly falls<br>
Upon the forgotten canvas, that the artist <br>
Completes from memory alone.<br>
</p>

<p>
Crouched behind the boulders, an anxious dog <br>
Watched us with angry eye,<br>
Waiting for the moment to take back from the carcass <br>
The morsel he had left.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; And yet you will be like this corruption,<br>
Like this horrible infection,<br>
Star of my eyes, sunlight of my being, <br>
You, my angel and my passion!<br>
</p>

<p>
Yes! thus will you be, queen of the Graces,<br>
After the last sacraments,<br>
When you go beneath grass and luxuriant flowers, <br>
To molder among the bones of the dead.<br>
</p>

<p>
Then, O my beauty! say to the worms who will<br>
Devour you with kisses,<br>
That I have kept the form and the divine essence <br>
Of my decomposed love!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Carcase</b>
</p>

<p>
The object that we saw, let us recall, <br>
This summer morn when warmth and beauty mingle &mdash; <br>
At the path's turn, a carcase lay asprawl<br>
Upon a bed of shingle.<br>
</p>

<p>
Legs raised, like some old whore far-gone in passion, <br>
The burning, deadly, poison-sweating mass <br>
Opened its paunch in careless, cynic fashion, <br>
Ballooned with evil gas.<br>
</p>

<p>
On this putrescence the sun blazed in gold, <br>
Cooking it to a turn with eager care &mdash; <br>
So to repay to Nature, hundredfold, <br>
What she had mingled there.<br>
</p>

<p>
The sky, as on the opening of a flower, <br>
On this superb obscenity smiled bright. <br>
The stench drove at us, with such fearsome power <br>
You thought you'd swoon outright.<br>
</p>

<p>
Flies trumpeted upon the rotten belly <br>
Whence larvae poured in legions far and wide, <br>
And flowed, like molten and liquescent jelly, <br>
Down living rags of hide.<br>
</p>

<p>
The mass ran down, or, like a wave elated <br>
Rolled itself on, and crackled as if frying: <br>
You'd think that corpse, by vague breath animated, <br>
Drew life from multiplying.<br>
</p>

<p>
Through that strange world a rustling rumour ran <br>
Like rushing water or a gust of air, <br>
Or grain that winnowers, with rhythmic fan, <br>
Sweep simmering here and there.<br>
</p>

<p>
It seemed a dream after the forms grew fainter, <br>
Or like a sketch that slowly seems to dawn <br>
On a forgotten canvas, which the painter <br>
From memory has drawn.<br>
</p>

<p>
Behind the rocks a restless cur that slunk <br>
Eyed us with fretful greed to recommence <br>
His feast, amidst the bonework, on the chunk <br>
That he had torn from thence.<br>
</p>

<p>
Yet you'll resemble this infection too <br>
One day, and stink and sprawl in such a fashion, <br>
Star of my eyes, sun of my nature, you, <br>
My angel and my passion!<br>
</p>

<p>
Yes, you must come to this, O queen of graces, <br>
At length, when the last sacraments are over, <br>
And you go down to moulder in dark places <br>
Beneath the grass and clover.<br>
</p>

<p>
Then tell the vermin as it takes its pleasance <br>
And feasts with kisses on that face of yours, <br>
I've kept intact in form and godlike essence <br>
Our decomposed amours!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>A Carcass</b>
</p>

<p>
Recall to mind the sight we saw, my soul,<br>
That soft, sweet summer day:<br>
Upon a bed of flints a carrion foul,<br>
Just as we turn'd the way,<br>
</p>

<p>
Its legs erected, wanton-like, in air,<br>
Burning and sweating pest,<br>
In unconcern'd and cynic sort laid bare<br>
To view its noisome breast.<br>
</p>

<p>
The sun lit up the rottenness with gold,<br>
To bake it well inclined,<br>
And give great Nature back a hundredfold<br>
All she together join'd.<br>
</p>

<p>
The sky regarded as the carcass proud<br>
Oped flower-like to the day;<br>
So strong the odour, on the grass you vow'd<br>
You thought to faint away.<br>
</p>

<p>
The flies the putrid belly buzz'd about,<br>
Whence black battalions throng<br>
Of maggots, like thick liquid flowing out<br>
The living rags along.<br>
</p>

<p>
And as a wave they mounted and went down,<br>
Or darted sparkling wide;<br>
As if the body, by a wild breath blown,<br>
Lived as it multiplied.<br>
</p>

<p>
From all this life a music strange there ran,<br>
Like wind and running burns;<br>
Or like the wheat a winnower in his fan<br>
With rhythmic movement turns.<br>
</p>

<p>
The forms wore off, and as a dream grew faint,<br>
An outline dimly shown,<br>
And which the artist finishes to paint<br>
From memory alone.<br>
</p>

<p>
Behind the rocks watch'd us with angry eye<br>
A bitch disturb'd in theft,<br>
Waiting to take, till we had pass'd her by,<br>
The morsel she had left.<br>
</p>

<p>
Yet you will be like that corruption too,<br>
Like that infection prove &mdash;<br>
Star of my eyes, sun of my nature, you,<br>
My angel and my love!<br>
</p>

<p>
Queen of the graces, you will even be so,<br>
When, the last ritual said,<br>
Beneath the grass and the fat flowers you go,<br>
To mould among the dead.<br>
</p>

<p>
Then, O my beauty, tell the insatiate worm<br>
Who wastes you with his kiss,<br>
I have kept the godlike essence and the form<br>
Of perishable bliss!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Richard Herne Shepherd, <i>Translations from Charles Baudelaire</i> (London: John Camden Hotten, 1869)
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Carrion</b>
</p>

<p>
Darling, do you recall that thing we found<br>
(&quot;A lovely summer day!&quot; you said)<br>
That noisome carcass where the path swung round<br>
A sprawling pebble-covered bed.<br>
</p>

<p>
Its legs raised like a whore's in lubric play,<br>
It burned, oozing rank fetors there,<br>
Shameless and nonchalant, it offered day<br>
Its belly. Poisons filled the air.<br>
</p>

<p>
The sun beat down on this putrescent mold<br>
As if to fry it to a turn,<br>
To give great Nature back one hundredfold<br>
All she had gathered in her urn.<br>
</p>

<p>
The skies watched that proud carcass, lax or taut,<br>
Bloom like a flowery mass.<br>
So pungent was the stench, my love, you thought<br>
To swoon away upon the grass.<br>
</p>

<p>
Horseflies buzzed loud over this putrid belly,<br>
Whence sallied column and battalion<br>
Of sable maggots, flowing like a mucose jelly,<br>
Over this live tatterdemalion.<br>
</p>

<p>
Waves seemed to rise and fall over this mass,<br>
Spurting with crepitation,<br>
As though this corpse, filled with breaths of gas,<br>
Lived by multiplication.<br>
</p>

<p>
This world uttered a curious melody,<br>
Like waters, wind, or grains of wheat<br>
That winnowers keep stirring rhythmically<br>
In the broad baskets at their feet.<br>
</p>

<p>
The forms, fading into a dream, grew fainter;<br>
Here was a sketch of misty tone<br>
On a forgotten canvas which the painter<br>
Completes from memory alone.<br>
</p>

<p>
Hiding behind the rocks, an anxious bitch<br>
Stood, watching us with angry eye,<br>
Poised to regain the olid morsel which,<br>
Hearing us come, she had laid by.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Yet shall you be like this ordurous blight,<br>
You, too, shall rot in just such fashion,<br>
Star of my eyes, sun of my soul's delight,<br>
Aye, you, my angel and my passion.<br>
</p>

<p>
Such you, O queen of graces, in the hours,<br>
When the last sacrament is said,<br>
That bear you under rich sods and Iush flower<br>
To molder with the moldering dead.<br>
</p>

<p>
Then, O my beauty! Tell such worms as will<br>
Kiss you in ultimate coition<br>
That I have kept the form and essence of<br>
My love in its decomposition.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jacques LeClercq, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (Mt Vernon, NY: Peter Pauper Press, 1958)
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>A Carrion</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Rememberest thou, my sweet, that summer's day, <br>
How in the sun outspread <br>
At a path's bend a filthy carcase lay <br>
Upon a pebbly bed? <br>
</p>

<p>
Like a lewd woman, with its legs in air, <br>
Burned, oozed the poisonous mass; <br>
Its gaping belly, calm and debonair, <br>
Was full of noisome gas. <br>
</p>

<p>
And steadily upon this rottenness. <br>
As though to cook it brown <br>
And render Nature hundredfold excess. <br>
The sun shone down. <br>
</p>

<p>
The blue sky thought the carrion marvellous, <br>
A flower most fair to see; <br>
And as we gazed it almost poisoned us &mdash; <br>
It stank so horribly. <br>
</p>

<p>
The flies buzzed on this putrid belly, whence <br>
Black hosts of maggots came, <br>
Which streamed in thick and shining rivers thence <br>
Along that ragged frame. <br>
</p>

<p>
Pulsating like a wave, spirting about <br>
Bright jets, it seemed to live; <br>
As though it were by some vague wind blown out, <br>
Some breath procreative. <br>
</p>

<p>
And all this life was strangely musical <br>
Like wind or bubbling spring, <br>
Or corn which moves with rhythmic rise and fall <br>
In time of winnowing. <br>
</p>

<p>
The lines became indefinite and faint <br>
As a thin dream that dies, <br>
A half-forgotten scene the hand can paint <br>
Only from memories...<br>
</p>

<p>
Behind the rocks there lurked a hungry hound <br>
With melancholy eye, <br>
Longing to nose the morsel he had found <br>
And gnaw it greedily. <br>
</p>

<p>
Yet thou shalt be as vile a carrion <br>
As this infection dire, <br>
O bright star of my eyes, my nature's sun, <br>
My angel, my desire! <br>
</p>

<p>
Yea, such, O queen of the graces, shalt thou be <br>
After the last soft breath. <br>
Beneath the grass and the lush greenery <br>
A-mouldering in death! <br>
</p>

<p>
When thy sweet flesh the worms devour with kisses, <br>
Tell them, O beauty mine. <br>
Of rotting loves I keep the bodily blisses <br>
And essence all-divine! <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jack Collings Squire, <i>Poems and Baudelaire Flowers</i> (London: The New Age Press, Ltd, 1909)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Corpse</b>
</p>

<p>
Remember, my Beloved, what thing we met<br>
By the roadside on that sweet summer day;<br>
There on a grassy couch with pebbles set,<br>
A loathsome body lay.<br>
</p>

<p>
The wanton limbs stiff-stretched into the air,<br>
Steaming with exhalations vile and dank,<br>
In ruthless cynic fashion had laid bare<br>
The swollen side and flank.<br>
</p>

<p>
On this decay the sun shone hot from heaven<br>
As though with chemic heat to broil and bum,<br>
And unto Nature all that she had given<br>
A hundredfold return.<br>
</p>

<p>
The sky smiled down upon the horror there<br>
As on a flower that opens to the day;<br>
So awful an infection smote the air,<br>
Almost you swooned away.<br>
</p>

<p>
The swarming flies hummed on the putrid side,<br>
Whence poured the maggots in a darkling stream,<br>
That ran along these tatters of life's pride<br>
With a liquescent gleam.<br>
</p>

<p>
And like a wave the maggots rose and fell,<br>
The murmuring flies swirled round in busy strife:<br>
It seemed as though a vague breath came to swell<br>
And multiply with life<br>
</p>

<p>
The hideous corpse. From all this living world<br>
A music as of wind and water ran,<br>
Or as of grain in rhythmic motion swirled<br>
By the swift winnower's fan.<br>
</p>

<p>
And then the vague forms like a dream died out,<br>
Or like some distant scene that slowly falls<br>
Upon the artist's canvas, that with doubt<br>
He only half recalls.<br>
</p>

<p>
A homeless dog behind the boulders lay<br>
And watched us both with angry eyes forlorn,<br>
Waiting a chance to come and take away<br>
The morsel she had torn.<br>
</p>

<p>
And you, even you, will be like this drear thing,<br>
A vile infection man may not endure;<br>
Star that I yearn to! Sun that lights my spring!<br>
O passionate and pure!<br>
</p>

<p>
Yes, such will you be, Queen of every grace!<br>
When the last sacramental words are said;<br>
And beneath grass and flowers that lovely face<br>
Moulders among the dead.<br>
</p>

<p>
Then, O Belovèd, whisper to the worm<br>
That crawls up to devour you with a kiss,<br>
That I still guard in memory the dear form<br>
Of love that comes to this!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; F.P. Sturm, from <i>Baudelaire: His Prose and Poetry</i>, edited by Thomas Robert Smith (New York: Boni and Liveright, 1919)
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>A Carrion</b>
</p>

<p>
Do you remember the thing we saw, my soul,<br>
That summer morning, so beautiful, so soft:<br>
At a turning in the path, a filthy carrion,<br>
On a bed sown with stones,<br>
</p>

<p>
Legs in the air, like a lascivious woman,<br>
Burning and sweating poisons,<br>
Opened carelessly, cynically,<br>
Its great fetid belly.<br>
</p>

<p>
The sun shone on this fester,<br>
As though to cook it to a turn,<br>
And to return a hundredfold to great Nature<br>
What she had joined in one;<br>
</p>

<p>
And the sky saw the superb carcass<br>
Open like a flower.<br>
The stench was so strong, that you might think<br>
To swoon away upon the grass.<br>
</p>

<p>
The flies swarmed on that rotten belly,<br>
Whence came out black battalions<br>
Of spawn, flowing like a thick liquid<br>
Along its living tatters.<br>
</p>

<p>
All this rose and fell like a wave,<br>
Or rustled in jerks;<br>
One would have said that the body, fun of a loose breath,<br>
Lived in this its procreation.<br>
</p>

<p>
And this world gave out a strange music,<br>
Like flowing water and wind,<br>
Or a winnower's grain that he shakes and turns<br>
With rhythmical grace in his basket.<br>
</p>

<p>
The forms fade and are no more than a dream, <br>
A sketch slow to come<br>
On the forgotten canvas, and that the artist completes <br>
Only by memory.<br>
</p>

<p>
Behind the boulders an anxious bitch<br>
Watched us with angry eyes,<br>
Spying the moment to regain in the skeleton <br>
The morsel she had dropped.<br>
</p>

<p>
 &mdash;  And yet you will be like this excrement,<br>
This horrible stench,<br>
O star of my eyes, sun of my being, <br>
You, my angel, my passion.<br>
</p>

<p>
Yes, such you will be, queen of gracefulness, <br>
After the last sacraments,<br>
When you go beneath the grasses and fat flowers,<br>
Moldering amongst the bones.<br>
</p>

<p>
Then, my beauty, say to the vermin<br>
Which will eat you with kisses,<br>
That I have kept the shape and the divine substance <br>
Of my decomposed loves!<br>
</p>
