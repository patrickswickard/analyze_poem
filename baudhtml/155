<b>Les Chats</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Les amoureux fervents et les savants aust&egrave;res<br>
Aiment &eacute;galement, dans leur m&ucirc;re saison,<br>
Les chats puissants et doux, orgueil de la maison,<br>
Qui comme eux sont frileux et comme eux s&eacute;dentaires.<br>
</p>

<p>
Amis de la science et de la volupt&eacute;<br>
Ils cherchent le silence et l'horreur des t&eacute;n&egrave;bres;<br>
L'Er&egrave;be les e&ucirc;t pris pour ses coursiers fun&egrave;bres,<br>
S'ils pouvaient au servage incliner leur fiert&eacute;.<br>
</p>

<p>
Ils prennent en songeant les nobles attitudes<br>
Des grands sphinx allong&eacute;s au fond des solitudes,<br>
Qui semblent s'endormir dans un r&ecirc;ve sans fin;<br>
</p>

<p>
Leurs reins f&eacute;conds sont pleins d'&eacute;tincelles magiques,<br>
Et des parcelles d'or, ainsi qu'un sable fin,<br>
Etoilent vaguement leurs prunelles mystiques.<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>Cats</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Both ardent lovers and austere scholars <br>
Love in their mature years <br>
The strong and gentle cats, pride of the house, <br>
Who like them are sedentary and sensitive to cold.<br>
</p>

<p>
Friends of learning and sensual pleasure, <br>
They seek the silence and the horror of darkness; <br>
Erebus would have used them as his gloomy steeds: <br>
If their pride could let them stoop to bondage.<br>
</p>

<p>
When they dream, they assume the noble attitudes <br>
Of the mighty sphinxes stretched out in solitude, <br>
Who seem to fall into a sleep of endless dreams;<br>
</p>

<p>
Their fertile loins are full of magic sparks, <br>
And particles of gold, like fine grains of sand, <br>
Spangle dimly their mystic eyes.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Cats</b>
</p>

<p>
Sages austere and fervent lovers both, <br>
In their ripe season, cherish cats, the pride <br>
Of hearths, strong, mild, and to themselves allied <br>
In chilly stealth and sedentary sloth.<br>
</p>

<p>
Friends both to lust and learning, they frequent <br>
Silence, and love the horror darkness breeds. <br>
Erebus would have chosen them for steeds <br>
To hearses, could their pride to it have bent.<br>
</p>

<p>
Dreaming, the noble postures they assume <br>
Of sphinxes stretching out into the gloom <br>
That seems to swoon into an endless trance.<br>
</p>

<p>
Their fertile flanks are full of sparks that tingle, <br>
And particles of gold, like grains of shingle, <br>
Vaguely be-star their pupils as they glance.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Cats</b>
</p>

<p>
No one but indefatigable lovers and old <br>
Chilly philosophers can understand the true <br>
Charm of these animals serene and potent, who <br>
Likewise are sedentary and suffer from the cold.<br>
</p>

<p>
They are the friends of learning and of sexual bliss; <br>
Silence they love, and darkness, where temptation breeds. <br>
Erebus would have made them his funereal steeds, <br>
Save that their proud free nature would not stoop to this.<br>
</p>

<p>
Like those great sphinxes lounging through eternity <br>
In noble attitudes upon the desert sand, <br>
They gaze incuriously at nothing, calm and wise.<br>
</p>

<p>
Their fecund loins give forth electric flashes, and <br>
Thousands of golden particles drift ceaselessly, <br>
Like galaxies of stars, in their mysterious eyes.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; George Dillon, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Cats</b>
</p>

<p>
All ardent lovers and all sages prize, <br>
&mdash; As ripening years incline upon their brows &mdash;<br>
The mild and mighty cats &mdash; pride of the house &mdash;<br>
That like unto them are indolent, stern and wise. <br>
</p>

<p>
The friends of Learning and of Ecstasy, <br>
They search for silence and the horrors of gloom;<br>
The devil had used them for his steeds of Doom, <br>
Could he alone have bent their pride to slavery. <br>
</p>

<p>
When musing, they display those outlines chaste, <br>
Of the great sphinxes &mdash; stretched o'er the sandy waste, <br>
That seem to slumber deep in a dream without end: <br>
</p>

<p>
From out their loins a fountainous furnace flies, <br>
And grains of sparkling gold, as fine as sand, <br>
Bestar the mystic pupils of their eyes. <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Cyril Scott, <i>Baudelaire: The Flowers of Evil</i> (London: Elkin Mathews, 1909)
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Cats</b><br>
</p>

<p>
The lover and the stern philosopher <br>
Both love, in their ripe time, the confident <br>
Soft cats, the house's chiefest ornament, <br>
Who like themselves are cold and seldom stir. <br>
</p>

<p>
Of knowledge and of pleasure amorous, <br>
Silence they seek and Darkness' fell domain; <br>
Had not their proud souls scorned to brook his rein, <br>
They would have made grim steeds for Erebus. <br>
</p>

<p>
Pensive they rest in noble attitudes <br>
Like great stretched sphinxes in vast solitudes <br>
Which seem to sleep wrapt in an endless dream; <br>
</p>

<p>
Their fruitful loins are full of sparks divine, <br>
And gleams of gold within their pupils shine <br>
As 'twere within the shadow of a stream. <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jack Collings Squire, <i>Poems and Baudelaire Flowers</i> (London: The New Age Press, Ltd, 1909)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Cats</b>
</p>

<p>
The ardent lovers and the stern students <br>
in their maturity, love equally, <br>
the gentle, powerful cats, pride of the family, <br>
they too feel the cold and favour indolence. <br>
</p>

<p>
Companions of knowledge and desire <br>
they seek the silent horrors darkness breeds, <br>
Erebus would take them for his funeral steeds,<br>
were they able to soften their pride.<br>
</p>

<p>
They take as they dream the noble pose <br>
of the great sphinxes, reclined in desolate land, <br>
lost, it seems, in an endless doze <br>
</p>

<p>
Their fecund loins brim with enchanting glitter, <br>
whilst their haunting eyes at random flicker <br>
with particles of gold, like fine sand.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Claire Trevien

Two editions of <i>Fleurs du mal</i> were published in Baudelaire's lifetime &mdash; one in 1857 and an expanded edition in 1861. "Scraps" and censored poems were collected in <i>Les &Eacute;paves</i> in 1866. After Baudelaire died the following year, a "definitive" edition appeared in 1868.
