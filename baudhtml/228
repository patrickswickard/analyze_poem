<b>R&ecirc;ve parisien</b><br>
</p>


<p>
<i>&Agrave; Constantin Guys</i><br>
</p>

<p>
I
</p>

<p>
De ce terrible paysage,<br>
Tel que jamais mortel n'en vit,<br>
Ce matin encore l'image,<br>
Vague et lointaine, me ravit.<br>
</p>

<p>
Le sommeil est plein de miracles!<br>
Par un caprice singulier<br>
J'avais banni de ces spectacles<br>
Le v&eacute;g&eacute;tal irr&eacute;gulier,<br>
</p>

<p>
Et, peintre fier de mon g&eacute;nie,<br>
Je savourais dans mon tableau<br>
L'enivrante monotonie<br>
Du m&eacute;tal, du marbre et de l'eau.<br>
</p>

<p>
Babel d'escaliers et d'arcades,<br>
C'&eacute;tait un palais infini<br>
Plein de bassins et de cascades<br>
Tombant dans l'or mat ou bruni;<br>
</p>

<p>
Et des cataractes pesantes,<br>
Comme des rideaux de cristal<br>
Se suspendaient, &eacute;blouissantes,<br>
&Agrave; des murailles de m&eacute;tal.<br>
</p>

<p>
Non d'arbres, mais de colonnades<br>
Les &eacute;tangs dormants s'entouraient<br>
O&ugrave; de gigantesques na&iuml;ades,<br>
Comme des femmes, se miraient.<br>
</p>

<p>
Des nappes d'eau s'&eacute;panchaient, bleues,<br>
Entre des quais roses et verts,<br>
Pendant des millions de lieues,<br>
Vers les confins de l'univers:<br>
</p>

<p>
C'&eacute;taient des pierres inou&iuml;es<br>
Et des flots magiques, c'&eacute;taient<br>
D'immenses glaces &eacute;blouies<br>
Par tout ce qu'elles refl&eacute;taient!<br>
</p>

<p>
Insouciants et taciturnes,<br>
Des Ganges, dans le firmament,<br>
Versaient le tr&eacute;sor de leurs urnes<br>
Dans des gouffres de diamant.<br>
</p>

<p>
Architecte de mes f&eacute;eries,<br>
Je faisais, &agrave; ma volont&eacute;,<br>
Sous un tunnel de pierreries<br>
Passer un oc&eacute;an dompt&eacute;;<br>
</p>

<p>
Et tout, m&ecirc;me la couleur noire,<br>
Semblait fourbi, clair, iris&eacute;;<br>
Le liquide ench&acirc;ssait sa gloire<br>
Dans le rayon cristallis&eacute;.<br>
</p>

<p>
Nul astre d'ailleurs, nuls vestiges<br>
De soleil, m&ecirc;me au bas du ciel,<br>
Pour illuminer ces prodiges,<br>
Qui brillaient d'un feu personnel!<br>
</p>

<p>
Et sur ces mouvantes merveilles<br>
Planait (terrible nouveaut&eacute;!<br>
Tout pour l'oeil, rien pour les oreilles!)<br>
Un silence d'&eacute;ternit&eacute;.<br>
</p>

<p>
II
</p>

<p>
En rouvrant mes yeux pleins de flamme<br>
J'ai vu l'horreur de mon taudis,<br>
Et senti, rentrant dans mon &acirc;me,<br>
La pointe des soucis maudits;<br>
</p>

<p>
La pendule aux accents fun&egrave;bres<br>
Sonnait brutalement midi,<br>
Et le ciel versait des t&eacute;n&egrave;bres<br>
Sur le triste monde engourdi.<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>Parisian Dream</b><br>
</p>

<p>
To Constantin Guys<br>
</p>

<p>
I<br>
</p>

<p>
This morning I am still entranced <br>
By the image, distant and dim, <br>
Of that awe-inspiring landscape <br>
Such as no mortal ever saw.<br>
</p>

<p>
Sleep is full of miracles!<br>
Obeying a curious whim,<br>
I had banned from that spectacle<br>
Irregular vegetation,<br>
</p>

<p>
And, painter proud of his genius, <br>
I savored in my picture <br>
The delightful monotony <br>
Of water, marble, and metal.<br>
</p>

<p>
Babel of arcades and stairways,<br>
It was a palace infinite,<br>
Full of basins and of cascades<br>
Falling on dull or burnished gold,<br>
</p>

<p>
And heavy waterfalls, <br>
Like curtains of crystal, <br>
Were hanging, bright and resplendent, <br>
From ramparts of metal.<br>
</p>

<p>
Not with trees but with colonnades <br>
The sleeping ponds were encircled; <br>
In these mirrors huge naiads <br>
Admired themselves like women.<br>
</p>

<p>
Streams of blue water flowed along <br>
Between rose and green embankments, <br>
Stretching away millions of leagues <br>
Toward the end of the universe;<br>
</p>

<p>
There were indescribable stones<br>
And magic waves; there were<br>
Enormous glaciers bedazzled<br>
By everything they reflected!<br>
</p>

<p>
Insouciant and taciturn, <br>
Ganges, in the firmament, <br>
Poured out the treasure of their urns <br>
Into chasms made of diamonds.<br>
</p>

<p>
Architect of my fairyland, <br>
Whenever it pleased me I made <br>
A vanquished ocean flow <br>
Into a tunnel of jewels;<br>
</p>

<p>
And all, even the color black, <br>
Seemed polished, bright, iridescent, <br>
Liquid enchased its own glory <br>
In the crystallized rays of light.<br>
</p>

<p>
Moreover, no star, no glimmer <br>
Of sun, even at the sky's rim, <br>
Illuminated these marvels <br>
That burned with a personal fire!<br>
</p>

<p>
And over these shifting wonders <br>
Hovered (terrible novelty! <br>
All for the eye, naught for the ear!) <br>
The silence of eternity.<br>
</p>

<p>
II<br>
</p>

<p>
Opening my eyes full of flames <br>
I saw my miserable room <br>
And felt the cursed blade of care <br>
Sink deep into my heart again;<br>
</p>

<p>
The clock with its death-like accent <br>
Was brutally striking noon; <br>
The sky was pouring down its gloom <br>
Upon the dismal, torpid world.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>

<br>

<p>
<b>Parisian Dream</b>
</p>

<p>
To Constantin Guys<br>
</p>

<p>
I<br>
</p>

<p>
Of the dread landscape that I saw, <br>
Where human eyes were never set, <br>
I still am ravished by the awe <br>
That, vague and distant, haunts me yet.<br>
</p>

<p>
Sleep is of miracles so fain <br>
That I (O singular caprice!) <br>
As being formless, could obtain <br>
That vegetable life should cease.<br>
</p>

<p>
A painter, in my genius free, <br>
I there exulted in the fettle <br>
Derived from a monotony <br>
Composed of marble, lymph, and metal.<br>
</p>

<p>
Babels of stairways and arcades, <br>
Endless and topless to behold, <br>
With ponds, and jets, and steep cascades <br>
Filling receptacles of gold:<br>
</p>

<p>
Ponderous cataracts there swung <br>
Like crystal curtains, foaming shawls &mdash; <br>
Dazzling and glittering they hung <br>
Suspended from the metal walls.<br>
</p>

<p>
Not trees, but colonnades, enclosed <br>
Motionless lakes, besides whose shelves <br>
Gigantic naiades reposed, <br>
Like women, gazing at themselves.<br>
</p>

<p>
Blue sheets of water interlay <br>
Unnumbered quays of green and rose, <br>
That stretched a million leagues away <br>
To where the bounds of space impose.<br>
</p>

<p>
'Twas formed of unknown stones that blazed <br>
And magic waves that intersect, <br>
Where icebergs floated, seeming dazed <br>
With all they mirror and reflect.<br>
</p>

<p>
Impassive, cold, and taciturn, <br>
Great Ganges, through the sky's vast prism, <br>
Each poured the treasures of its urn<br>
Into a diamond abysm.<br>
</p>

<p>
Architect of my fairy scene, <br>
I willed, by wondrous stratagems, <br>
An ocean, tamed, to pass between <br>
A tunnel that was made of gems.<br>
</p>

<p>
There all things, even the colour black, <br>
Seemed irridescently to play, <br>
And liquid crystalised its lack <br>
Of outline in a frozen ray.<br>
</p>

<p>
No star, no sun could be discerned, <br>
Even low down, in that vast sky: <br>
The fire was personal that burned <br>
To show these marvels to the eye.<br>
</p>

<p>
Above these moving wonders sheer <br>
There soared (that such a thing should be!<br>
All for the eye, none for the ear!) <br>
A silence of eternity.<br>
</p>

<p>
II<br>
</p>

<p>
My opening eyes, as red as coal, <br>
The horror of my lodging met. <br>
I felt re-entering my soul <br>
The knife of cares and vain regret.<br>
</p>

<p>
The clock with brutal accent played <br>
Funereal chimes. The time was noon <br>
And heaven covered, with its shade, <br>
The world, this fatuous balloon!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>

<p>
<b>Parisian Dream</b><br>
</p>

<p>
I<br>
</p>

<p>
That marvelous landscape of my dream &mdash; <br>
Which no eye knows, nor ever will &mdash;  <br>
At moments, wide awake, I seem <br>
To grasp, and it excites me still.<br>
</p>

<p>
Sleep, how miraculous you are &mdash; <br>
A strange caprice had urged my hand <br>
To banish, as irregular, <br>
All vegetation from that land;<br>
</p>

<p>
And, proud of what my art had done, <br>
I viewed my painting, knew the great <br>
Intoxicating monotone <br>
Of marble, water, steel and slate.<br>
</p>

<p>
Staircases and arcades there were <br>
In a long labyrinth, which led <br>
To a vast palace; fountains there <br>
Were gushing gold, and gushing lead.<br>
</p>

<p>
And many a heavy cataract <br>
Hung like a curtain, &mdash; did not fall, <br>
As water does, but hung, compact, <br>
Crystal, on many a metal wall.<br>
</p>

<p>
Tall nymphs with Titan breasts and knees <br>
Gazed at their images unblurred, <br>
Where groves of colonnades, not trees, <br>
Fringed a deep pool where nothing stirred.<br>
</p>

<p>
Blue sheets of water, left and right, <br>
Spread between quays of rose and green, <br>
To the world's end and out of sight, <br>
And still expanded, though unseen.<br>
</p>

<p>
Enchanted rivers, those &mdash; with jade <br>
And jasper were their banks bedecked; <br>
Enormous mirrors, dazzled, made <br>
Dizzy by all they did reflect.<br>
</p>

<p>
And many a Ganges, taciturn <br>
And heedless, in the vaulted air, <br>
Poured out the treasure of its urn <br>
Into a gulf of diamond there.<br>
</p>

<p>
As architect, it tempted me <br>
To tame the ocean at its source; <br>
And this I did, &mdash; I made the sea <br>
Under a jeweled culvert course.<br>
</p>

<p>
And every color, even black, <br>
Became prismatic, polished, bright; <br>
The liquid gave its glory back <br>
Mounted in iridescent light.<br>
</p>

<p>
There was no moon, there was no sun, &mdash; <br>
For why should sun and moon conspire<br>
To light such prodigies? &mdash; each one<br>
Blazed with its own essential fire!<br>
</p>

<p>
A silence like eternity <br>
Prevailed, there was no sound to hear; <br>
These marvels all were for the eye, <br>
And there was nothing for the ear.<br>
</p>

<p>
II<br>
</p>

<p>
I woke; my mind was bright with flame; <br>
I saw the cheap and sordid hole <br>
I live in, and my cares all came <br>
Burrowing back into my soul.<br>
</p>

<p>
Brutally the twelve strokes of noon <br>
Against my naked ear were hurled; <br>
And a gray sky was drizzling down <br>
Upon this sad, lethargic world.<br>
</p>

<p>
