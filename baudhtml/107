<b>La Muse v&eacute;nale</b><br>
</p>

<p>
&Ocirc; muse de mon coeur, amante des palais,<br>
Auras-tu, quand Janvier l&acirc;chera ses Bor&eacute;es,<br>
Durant les noirs ennuis des neigeuses soir&eacute;es,<br>
Un tison pour chauffer tes deux pieds violets?<br>
</p>

<p>
Ranimeras-tu donc tes &eacute;paules marbr&eacute;es<br>
Aux nocturnes rayons qui percent les volets?<br>
Sentant ta bourse &agrave; sec autant que ton palais<br>
R&eacute;colteras-tu l'or des vo&ucirc;tes azur&eacute;es?<br>
</p>

<p>
II te faut, pour gagner ton pain de chaque soir,<br>
Comme un enfant de choeur, jouer de l'encensoir,<br>
Chanter des Te Deum auxquels tu ne crois gu&egrave;re,<br>
</p>

<p>
Ou, saltimbanque &agrave; jeun, &eacute;taler tes appas <br>
Et ton rire tremp&eacute; de pleurs qu'on ne voit pas,<br>
Pour faire &eacute;panouir la rate du vulgaire.<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>The Venal Muse</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Muse of my heart, you who love palaces, <br>
When January frees his north winds, will you have, <br>
During the black ennui of snowy evenings, <br>
An ember to warm your two feet blue with cold?<br>
</p>

<p>
Will you bring the warmth back to your mottled shoulders, <br>
With the nocturnal beams that pass through the shutters? <br>
Knowing that your purse is as dry as your palate, <br>
Will you harvest the gold of the blue, vaulted sky?<br>
</p>

<p>
To earn your daily bread you are obliged<br>
To swing the censer like an altar boy,<br>
And to sing <i>Te Deums</i> in which you don't believe,<br>
</p>

<p>
Or, hungry mountebank, to put up for sale your charm, <br>
Your laughter wet with tears which people do not see, <br>
To make the vulgar herd shake with laughter.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Venal Muse</b>
</p>

<p>
Muse of my heart, of palaces the lover, <br>
Where will you, when the blast of winter blows<br>
In the black boredom of snowed lights, discover <br>
A glowing brand to warm your violet toes?<br>
</p>

<p>
How will you there revive your marbled skin <br>
At the chill rays your shutters then disperse? <br>
The gold of azure heavens will you win <br>
When empty are your palate and your purse?<br>
</p>

<p>
You'll need each evening, then, to earn your bread, <br>
As choirboys swinging censers that are dead <br>
Who sing Te Deums which they disbelieve:<br>
</p>

<p>
Or, fasting pierrette, trade your loveliness <br>
And laughter, soaked in tears that none can guess, <br>
The boredom of the vulgar to relieve.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Venal Muse</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Lover of palaces, Muse of my heart, O sweet,<br>
When hailstones fly from January's frosty sling,<br>
On snowy nights amid black ennui, who shall bring<br>
A cheery log to thaw your violet chill feet?<br>
Shall you warm your wan mottled shoulder with the wing<br>
Of bleak nocturnal beams that soar from the dank street?<br>
Knowing you have no coin in purse nor bread to eat,<br>
Shall you rake gold from blue arched skies for harvesting?<br>
</p>

<p>
To earn your daily bread as the dense nights grow denser,<br>
Shall you play acolyte and blithely swing your censer,<br>
Chanting faithless Te Deums; or a moment after,<br>
A famished mountebank, sell the charmed mysteries<br>
Of laughter bathed in tears that no man ever sees<br>
To rouse the rabble herd to fits of obscene laughter?<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jacques LeClercq, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (Mt Vernon, NY: Peter Pauper Press, 1958)<br>
</p>

<p>
<b>The Mercenary Muse</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Muse of my heart, so fond of palaces, reply: <br>
When January sends those blizzards wild and white, <br>
Shall you have any fire at all to huddle by, <br>
Chafing your violet feet in the black snowy night?<br>
</p>

<p>
Think: when the moon shines through the window, shall you try <br>
To thaw your marble shoulders in her square of light? <br>
Think: when your purse is empty and your palate dry, <br>
Can you from the starred heaven snatch all the gold in sight?<br>
</p>

<p>
No, no; if you would earn your bread, you have no choice <br>
But to become a choir-boy, and chant in a loud voice <br>
Te Deums you have no faith in, and swing your censer high;<br>
</p>

<p>
Or be a mountebank, employing all your art &mdash; <br>
Yes, on an empty stomach and with an anguished heart &mdash; <br>
To chase the boredom of the liverish gallery.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Edna St. Vincent Millay, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Venal Muse</b> <br>
</p>

<p>
Muse of my heart<br>
You are a lover<br>
Of January storms and sleet.<br>
Gleaming starlight<br>
Does not whet<br>
Your dead palate and<br>
Only complaints spring<br>
From your mouth about<br>
Your purse stuffed with azure.<br>
You hate the Te Deums<br>
I force you to sing <br>
And starve<br>
Waiting to feed on the anger<br>
Of commuters stuck in<br>
Afternoon traffic.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Will Schmitz<br>
</p>

<p>
<b>The Venal Muse</b>
</p>

<p>
Oh Muse of my heart &mdash; so fond of palaces old, <br>
Wilt have &mdash; when New-Year speeds its wintry blast, <br>
Amid those tedious nights, with snow o'ercast, <br>
A log to warm thy feet, benumbed with cold? <br>
</p>

<p>
Wilt thou thy marbled shoulders then revive <br>
With nightly rays that through thy shutters peep? <br>
And &mdash; void thy purse and void thy palace &mdash; reap <br>
A golden hoard within some azure hive? <br>
</p>

<p>
Thou must, to earn thy daily bread, each night, <br>
Suspend the censer like an acolyte, <br>
Te-Deums sing, with sanctimonious ease, <br>
</p>

<p>
Or as a famished mountebank, with jokes obscene <br>
Essay to lull the vulgar rabble's spleen;<br>
Thy laughter soaked in tears which no one sees. <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Cyril Scott, <i>Baudelaire: The Flowers of Evil</i> (London: Elkin Mathews, 1909)
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>La Muse v&eacute;nale</b><br>
</p>

<p>
o Muse I love, whom palaces delight,<br>
when 'round thy door the blasts of winter cry,<br>
wilt have, while snowy eves in boredom die,<br>
one ember left for feet all freezing white?<br>
</p>

<p>
wilt warm thy cold blue shoulders in the light<br>
the stars impart through shutters left awry?<br>
&mdash; or climb, with hungry mouth and purse, the sky<br>
to glean the gold from azure vaults of night?<br>
</p>

<p>
thou must, to earn thy daily bread, employ<br>
a well-swung censer, like a choir-boy,<br>
and chant <i>Te Deum</i> from a heart unstirred,<br>
</p>

<p>
or, starving clown, lay bare thy loveliness<br>
and laugh through tears thou darest not confess,<br>
to rouse the bilious humour of the herd.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Lewis Piaget Shanks, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (New York: Ives Washburn, 1931)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Venal Muse</b>
</p>

<p>
Muse of my heart, lover of palaces,<br>
When January comes with wind and sleet,<br>
During the snowy eve's long wearinesses,<br>
Will there be fire to warm thy violet feet?<br>
</p>

<p>
Wilt thou reanimate thy marble shoulders<br>
In the moon-beams that through the window fly?<br>
Or when thy purse dries up, thy palace moulders,<br>
Reap the far star-gold of the vaulted sky?<br>
</p>

<p>
For thou, to keep thy body to thy soul,<br>
Must swing a censer, wear a holy stole,<br>
And chaunt Te Deums with unbelief between.<br>
</p>

<p>
Or, like a starving mountebank, expose<br>
Thy beauty and thy tear-drowned smile to those<br>
Who wait thy jests to drive away thy spleen.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; F.P. Sturm, from <i>Baudelaire: His Prose and Poetry</i>, edited by Thomas Robert Smith (New York: Boni and Liveright, 1919)
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>La Muse v&eacute;nale</b>
</p>

<p>
Ma muse a ma ane, lover a riches 'n luxury, <br>
When January unleashes icy blasts 'n snows,<br>
While the icy nights smother us wi broodin<br>
Where will ye find the embers tae warm ma purple toes?
</p>

<p>
D'ye think the street lamps peepin through the windae blinds<br>
Will warm yer shivrin shoulders, or thase heedlamps a passin cars<br>
When yer belly's empty as yer pocket 'n yer gob's gone dry<br>
Will ye fill yer pockets wi the heavin's golden stars?
</p>

<p>
Or will ye recite the hymns a the Bible-punching bunch<br>
Tae win yersel a free ticket fer their street buffet lunch?<br>
Knowin' a the while that ye'r sellin yer soul cheap.<br>
Or, like the trapeze artist will ye swing and leap
</p>

<p>
Aboot, dain' yer acrobatics wi a painted smile <br>
Tae win their laughs an tips, greetin' inside a the while?
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Scots translation by James W. Underhill

<p>
<b>The Mercenary Muse</b><br>
</p>

<p>
O Muse of my heart, votary of palaces, <br>
Shall you, when January looses its boreal winds, <br>
Have any firebrand to warm your violet feet <br>
In the black boredoms of snowy evenings?<br>
</p>

<p>
Shall you revive your marble shoulders <br>
By the gleams of night that stab the shutters? <br>
And, feeling your purse as empty as your palace, <br>
Will you reap the gold of azure skies?<br>
</p>

<p>
To win your evening bread you need,<br>
Like a choir-boy, to play with the censer,<br>
To chant the Te Deums you scarcely believe in,<br>
</p>

<p>
Or, famished vagabond, expose your charms <br>
And your laughter soaked in crying that is not seen,<br>
In order to dispel the spleen of the people.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Geoffrey Wagner, <i>Selected Poems of Charles Baudelaire</i> (NY: Grove Press, 1974) <br>

Two editions of <i>Fleurs du mal</i> were published in Baudelaire's lifetime &mdash; one in 1857 and an expanded edition in 1861. "Scraps" and censored poems were collected in <i>Les &Eacute;paves</i> in 1866. After Baudelaire died the following year, a "definitive" edition appeared in 1868.
