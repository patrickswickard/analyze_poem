<b>Les Hiboux</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Sous les ifs noirs qui les abritent<br>
Les hiboux se tiennent rang&eacute;s<br>
Ainsi que des dieux &eacute;trangers<br>
Dardant leur oeil rouge. Ils m&eacute;ditent.<br>
</p>

<p>
Sans remuer ils se tiendront<br>
Jusqu'&agrave; l'heure m&eacute;lancolique<br>
O&ugrave;, poussant le soleil oblique,<br>
Les t&eacute;n&egrave;bres s'&eacute;tabliront.<br>
</p>

<p>
Leur attitude au sage enseigne<br>
Qu'il faut en ce monde qu'il craigne<br>
Le tumulte et le mouvement;<br>
</p>

<p>
L'homme ivre d'une ombre qui passe<br>
Porte toujours le ch&acirc;timent<br>
D'avoir voulu changer de place.<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>Owls</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Under the dark yews which shade them, <br>
The owls are perched in rows, <br>
Like so many strange gods, <br>
Darting their red eyes. They meditate.<br>
</p>

<p>
Without budging they will remain <br>
Till that melancholy hour <br>
When, pushing back the slanting sun, <br>
Darkness will take up its abode.<br>
</p>

<p>
Their attitude teaches the wise <br>
That in this world one must fear <br>
Movement and commotion;<br>
</p>

<p>
Man, enraptured by a passing shadow, <br>
Forever bears the punishment <br>
Of having tried to change his place.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Owls</b>
</p>

<p>
Within the shelter of black yews <br>
The owls in ranks are ranged apart <br>
Like foreign gods, whose eyeballs dart <br>
Red fire. They meditate and muse.<br>
</p>

<p>
Without a stir they will remain <br>
Till, in its melancholy hour, <br>
Thrusting the level sun from power, <br>
The shade establishes its reign.<br>
</p>

<p>
Their attitude instructs the sage, <br>
Content with what is near at hand, <br>
To shun all motion, strife, and rage.<br>
</p>

<p>
Men, crazed with shadows that they chase, <br>
Bear, as a punishment, the brand <br>
Of having wished to change their place.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Owls</b>
</p>

<p>
Upon black yew tree branches perch<br>
The owls, mute and self-possessed;<br>
They meditate like temple gods<br>
With ruby eyes and stony breast.<br>
</p>

<p>
No twitch or turn until the time,<br>
The fateful hour, when night shades fall<br>
And lean against the light, and dark<br>
Soon spreads dominion over all.<br>
</p>

<p>
Their poise will teach the wise how slight<br>
A rush and restlessness excite<br>
Our fears &mdash; a shadow glances by<br>
</p>
			
<p>
A drunk, who gasps a startled sigh,<br>
Regretting that he'd bid goodbye,<br>
To stagger homeward through the night.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Edward Eriksson
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Owls<br></b> 
</p>

<p>
Protected under black yew trees,<br>
The owls are perched in neat arrays.<br>
They meditate with scarlet gaze,<br>
Resembling foreign deities.<br>
</p>

<p>
Unmoving, they will stay until<br>
That melancholic moment when,<br>
Pursuing close the slanting sun,<br>
Arrives the covering darkness chill.<br>
</p>

<p>
Their poise imparts to the astute<br>
That any motion not minute<br>
Should be abhorred. And those<br>
</p>

<p>
Whom passing shadows captivate<br>
Will never find a true repose<br>
For their desire to relocate.<br>
</p>

<p>

<p>
<b>The Owls</b><br>
</p>

<p>
The owls that roost in the black yew <br>
Along one limb in solemn state, <br>
And with a red eye look you through, <br>
Are eastern gods; they meditate.<br>
</p>

<p>
No feather stirs on them, not one, <br>
Until that melancholy hour <br>
When night, supplanting the weak sun, <br>
Resumes her interrupted power.<br>
</p>

<p>
Their attitude instructs the wise<br>
To shun all action, all surprise.<br>
Suppose there passed a lovely face, &mdash; <br>
</p>

<p>
Who even longs to follow it, <br>
Must feel for ever the disgrace <br>
Of having all but moved a bit.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Edna St. Vincent Millay, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Owls</b>
</p>

<p>
Beneath the shades of sombre yews, <br>
The silent owls sit ranged in rows, <br>
Like ancient idols, strangely pose, <br>
And darting fiery eyes, they muse. <br>
</p>

<p>
Immovable, they sit and gaze, <br>
Until the melancholy hour, <br>
At which the darknesses devour <br>
The faded sunset's slanting rays. <br>
</p>

<p>
Their attitude, instructs the wise, <br>
That he &mdash; within this world &mdash; who flies <br>
From tumult and from merriment;<br>
</p>

<p>
The man allured by a passing face, <br>
For ever bears the chastisement <br>
Of having wished to change his place. <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Cyril Scott, <i>Baudelaire: The Flowers of Evil</i> (London: Elkin Mathews, 1909)
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Owls</b><br>
</p>

<p>
'Neath their black yews in solemn state <br>
The owls are sitting in a row <br>
Like foreign gods; and even so <br>
Blink their red eyes; they meditate. <br>
</p>

<p>
Quite motionless they hold them thus <br>
Until at last the day is done, <br>
And, driving down the slanting sun, <br>
The sad night is victorious. <br>
</p>

<p>
They teach the wise who gives them ear <br>
That in this world he most should fear <br>
All things which loud or restless be. <br>
</p>

<p>
Who, dazzled by a passing shade, <br>
Follows it, never will be free <br>
Till the dread penalty be paid. <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jack Collings Squire, <i>Poems and Baudelaire Flowers</i> (London: The New Age Press, Ltd, 1909)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Owls</b>
</p>

<p>
Under the overhanging yews,<br>
The dark owls sit in solemn state,<br>
Like stranger gods; by twos and twos<br>
Their red eyes gleam. They meditate.<br>
</p>

<p>
Motionless thus they sit and dream<br>
Until that melancholy hour<br>
When, with the sun's last fading gleam,<br>
The nightly shades assume their power.<br>
</p>

<p>
From their still attitude the wise<br>
Will learn with terror to despise<br>
All tumult, movement, and unrest;<br>
</p>

<p>
For he who follows every shade,<br>
Carries the memory in his breast,<br>
Of each unhappy journey made.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; F.P. Sturm, from <i>Baudelaire: His Prose and Poetry</i>, edited by Thomas Robert Smith (New York: Boni and Liveright, 1919)

Two editions of <i>Fleurs du mal</i> were published in Baudelaire's lifetime &mdash; one in 1857 and an expanded edition in 1861. "Scraps" and censored poems were collected in <i>Les &Eacute;paves</i> in 1866. After Baudelaire died the following year, a "definitive" edition appeared in 1868.
