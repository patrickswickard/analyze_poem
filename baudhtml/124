<b><i>Avec ses v&ecirc;tements ondoyants et nacr&eacute;s</i></b><br>
</p>

<p>
Avec ses v&ecirc;tements ondoyants et nacr&eacute;s,<br>
M&ecirc;me quand elle marche on croirait qu'elle danse,<br>
Comme ces longs serpents que les jongleurs sacr&eacute;s<br>
Au bout de leurs b&acirc;tons agitent en cadence.<br>
</p>

<p>
Comme le sable morne et l'azur des d&eacute;serts,<br>
Insensibles tous deux &agrave; l'humaine souffrance<br>
Comme les longs r&eacute;seaux de la houle des mers<br>
Elle se d&eacute;veloppe avec indiff&eacute;rence.<br>
</p>

<p>
Ses yeux polis sont faits de min&eacute;raux charmants,<br>
Et dans cette nature &eacute;trange et symbolique<br>
O&ugrave; l'ange inviol&eacute; se m&ecirc;le au sphinx antique,<br>
</p>

<p>
O&ugrave; tout n'est qu'or, acier, lumi&egrave;re et diamants,<br>
Resplendit &agrave; jamais, comme un astre inutile,<br>
La froide majest&eacute; de la femme st&eacute;rile.<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b><i>With Her Pearly, Undulating Dresses</i></b><br>
</p>

<p>
With her pearly, undulating dresses, <br>
Even when she's walking, she seems to be dancing <br>
Like those long snakes which the holy fakirs <br>
Set swaying in cadence on the end of their staffs.<br>
</p>

<p>
Like the dull sand and the blue of deserts, <br>
Both of them unfeeling toward human suffering, <br>
Like the long web of the ocean's billows, <br>
She unfurls herself with unconcern.<br>
</p>

<p>
Her glossy eyes are made of charming minerals<br>
And in that nature, symbolic and strange,<br>
Where pure angel is united with ancient sphinx,<br>
</p>

<p>
Where everything is gold, steel, light and diamonds, <br>
There glitters forever, like a useless star, <br>
The frigid majesty of the sterile woman.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b><i>With Waving Opalescence in Her Gown</i></b>
</p>

<p>
With waving opalescence in her gown, <br>
Even when she walks along, you think she's dancing. <br>
Like those long snakes which charmers, while entrancing,<br>
Wave with their wands, in cadence, up and down.<br>
</p>

<p>
Like the sad sands of deserts and their skies,<br>
By human sufferings untouched and free,<br>
Or like the surfy curtains of the sea,<br>
She flaunts a cold indifference. Her eyes<br>
</p>

<p>
Are made of charming minerals well-burnished. <br>
Her nature, both by sphynx and angel furnished, <br>
Is old, intact, symbolic, and bizarre:<br>
</p>

<p>
She seems, made all of gems, steel, light, and gold, <br>
In barrenness, majestic, hard, and cold, <br>
To blaze forever, like a useless star.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>She Doesn't Walk</b>
</p>

<p>
She doesn’t walk; she rather dances through salons<br>
Within her buoyant gowns of glittering, silver nacre,<br>
Curling like the snake of a turbaned Hindu fakir,<br>
Unrolled from in between his undulant batons.<br>
</p>

<p>
Like the dismal desert sands or its skies of endless blues,<br>
Oblivious to pain or grief or yearning sighs,<br>
Enveloping like nets of the sea-tide’s fall and rise,<br>
No passion she responds to, no injury she rues.<br>
</p>

<p>
Her suave marble eyes, profound, bizarre, and bright,<br>
Lure with a fascinating subtlety that links<br>
The smiling virgin seraph to the strange and ageless Sphinx.<br>
</p>

<p>
Here steel and diamond, gold and agate spark a light,<br>
Twinkling like a star’s eternal, icy flame,<br>
The distant, mystic beauty of the cold and sterile dame.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Edward Eriksson
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>XXVIII Sonnet</b>
</p>

<p>
In undulant robes with nacreous sheen impearled<br>
She walks as in some stately saraband;<br>
Or like lithe snakes by sacred charmers curled<br>
In cadence wreathing on the slender wand.<br>
</p>

<p>
Calm as blue wastes of sky and desert sand<br>
That watch unmoved the sorrows of this world;<br>
With slow regardless sweep as on the strand<br>
The long swell of the woven sea-waves swirled.<br>
</p>

<p>
Her polished orbs are like a mystic gem,<br>
And, while this strange and symbolled being links<br>
The inviolate angel and the antique sphinx,<br>
</p>

<p>
Insphered in gold, steel, light and diadem<br>
The splendour of a lifeless star endows<br>
With clear cold majesty the barren spouse.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; W. J. Robertson, from <i>Baudelaire: His Prose and Poetry</i>, edited by Thomas Robert Smith (New York: Boni and Liveright, 1919)
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Sonnet XXVIII</b>
</p>

<p>
With pearly robes that wave within the wind, <br>
Even when she walks, she seems to dance, <br>
Like swaying serpents round those wands entwined <br>
Which fakirs wave in rhythmic elegance. <br>
</p>

<p>
So like the desert's Blue, and the sands remote, <br>
Both, deaf to mortal suffering and to strife, <br>
Or like the sea-weeds 'neath the waves that float, <br>
Indifferently she moulds her budding life. <br>
</p>

<p>
Her polished eyes are made of minerals bright, <br>
And in her mien, symbolical and cold, <br>
Wherein an angel mingles with a sphinx of old, <br>
</p>

<p>
Where all is gold, and steel, and gems, and light, <br>
There shines, just like a useless star eternally, <br>
The sterile woman's frigid majesty. <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Cyril Scott, <i>Baudelaire: The Flowers of Evil</i> (London: Elkin Mathews, 1909)
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b><i>Avec ses v&ecirc;tements ondoyants et nacr&eacute;s</i></b><br>
</p>

<p>
with all her undulant pearly draperies,<br>
she moves in measures lovelier than a dance,<br>
as in the fakirs' Indian sorceries<br>
tall cobras 'neath a moving rod advance<br>
</p>

<p>
like drear Sahara's sand or azure skies,<br>
insentient both to human suffering,<br>
like the long lacy nets the surges bring,<br>
her slow indifferent length she amplifies.<br>
</p>

<p>
her eyes are made from agates polished bright,<br>
and in that strange symbolic soul which links<br>
the inviolate angel and the fabled sphynx,<br>
</p>

<p>
where all is gold, steel, diamonds and light,<br>
glitters forever, starlike, far, inhuman,<br>
the regal coldness of the sterile woman.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Lewis Piaget Shanks, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (New York: Ives Washburn, 1931)<br>
</p>

<br>


<p>
<b>Sonnet</b><br>
</p>

<p>
With her dresses undulating, pearly, <br>
Even walking one would think her dancing, <br>
Like those long serpents which holy charmers <br>
Move in harmony at the tips of their batons.<br>
</p>

<p>
Like the dull sand and the blue of deserts, <br>
Unmoved alike by human pain, <br>
Like the long fabric of the swell of seas, <br>
She unfolds herself with indifference.<br>
</p>

<p>
Her polished eyes are of delicious metals,<br>
And in this strange, symbolic nature<br>
Where virgin angel meets with ancient sphinx,<br>
</p>

<p>
Where all is only gold and steel and light and diamonds, <br>
There shines for ever, like a useless star, <br>
The cold majesty of the sterile woman.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Geoffrey Wagner, <i>Selected Poems of Charles Baudelaire</i> (NY: Grove Press, 1974) <br>

Two editions of <i>Fleurs du mal</i> were published in Baudelaire's lifetime &mdash; one in 1857 and an expanded edition in 1861. "Scraps" and censored poems were collected in <i>Les &Eacute;paves</i> in 1866. After Baudelaire died the following year, a "definitive" edition appeared in 1868.
