<b>L'Invitation au voyage</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Mon enfant, ma soeur,<br>
Songe &agrave; la douceur<br>
D'aller l&agrave;-bas vivre ensemble!<br>
Aimer &agrave; loisir,<br>
Aimer et mourir<br>
Au pays qui te ressemble!<br>
Les soleils mouill&eacute;s<br>
De ces ciels brouill&eacute;s<br>
Pour mon esprit ont les charmes<br>
Si myst&eacute;rieux<br>
De tes tra&icirc;tres yeux,<br>
Brillant &agrave; travers leurs larmes.<p>
L&agrave;, tout n'est qu'ordre et beaut&eacute;,<br>
Luxe, calme et volupt&eacute;.<br>
</p>

<p>
Des meubles luisants,<br>
Polis par les ans,<br>
D&eacute;coreraient notre chambre;<br>
Les plus rares fleurs<br>
M&ecirc;lant leurs odeurs<br>
Aux vagues senteurs de l'ambre,<br>
Les riches plafonds,<br>
Les miroirs profonds,<br>
La splendeur orientale,<br>
Tout y parlerait<br>
&Agrave; l'&acirc;me en secret<br>
Sa douce langue natale.<p>
L&agrave;, tout n'est qu'ordre et beaut&eacute;,<br>
Luxe, calme et volupt&eacute;.<br>
</p>

<p>
Vois sur ces canaux<br>
Dormir ces vaisseaux<br>
Dont l'humeur est vagabonde;<br>
C'est pour assouvir<br>
Ton moindre d&eacute;sir<br>
Qu'ils viennent du bout du monde.<br>
&#151; Les soleils couchants<br>
Rev&ecirc;tent les champs,<br>
Les canaux, la ville enti&egrave;re,<br>
D'hyacinthe et d'or;<br>
Le monde s'endort<br>
Dans une chaude lumi&egrave;re.<p>
L&agrave;, tout n'est qu'ordre et beaut&eacute;,<br>
Luxe, calme et volupt&eacute;.<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>Invitation to the Voyage</b><br>
</p>

<p>
My child, my sister,<br>
Think of the rapture<br>
Of living together there! <br>
Of loving at will, <br>
Of loving till death,<br>
In the land that is like you! <br>
The misty sunlight <br>
Of those cloudy skies<br>
Has for my spirit the charms, <br>
So mysterious, <br>
Of your treacherous eyes,<br>
Shining brightly through their tears.<br>
</p>

<p>
There all is order and beauty,<br>
Luxury, peace, and pleasure.<br>
</p>

<p>
Gleaming furniture,<br>
Polished by the years,<br>
Will ornament our bedroom;<br>
The rarest flowers<br>
Mingling their fragrance<br>
With the faint scent of amber,<br>
The ornate ceilings,<br>
The limpid mirrors,<br>
The oriental splendor,<br>
All would whisper there<br>
Secretly to the soul<br>
In its soft, native language.<br>
</p>

<p>
There all is order and beauty,<br>
Luxury, peace, and pleasure.<br>
</p>

<p>
See on the canals <br>
Those vessels sleeping.<br>
Their mood is adventurous;<br>
It's to satisfy<br>
Your slightest desire<br>
That they come from the ends of the earth.<br>
&mdash; The setting suns<br>
Adorn the fields,<br>
The canals, the whole city,<br>
With hyacinth and gold;<br>
The world falls asleep<br>
In a warm glow of light.<br>
</p>

<p>
There all is order and beauty,<br>
Luxury, peace, and pleasure.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>

<p>
<b>Invitation to the Voyage</b>
</p>

<p>
My daughter, my sister, <br>
Consider the vista <br>
Of living out there, you and I,<br>
To love at our leisure, <br>
Then, ending our pleasure, <br>
In climes you resemble to die. <br>
There the suns, rainy-wet, <br>
Through clouds rise and set <br>
With the selfsame enchantment to charm me <br>
That my senses receive <br>
From your eyes, that deceive, <br>
When they shine through your tears to disarm me.<br>
</p>

<p>
There'll be nothing but beauty, wealth, pleasure, <br>
With all things in order and measure.<br>
</p>

<p>
With old treasures furnished, <br>
By centuries burnished, <br>
To gleam in the shade of our chamber, <br>
While the rarest of flowers <br>
Vaguely mix through the hours <br>
Their own with the perfume of amber: <br>
Each sumptuous ceiling, <br>
Each mirror revealing <br>
The wealth of the East, will be hung <br>
So the part and the whole <br>
May speak to the soul <br>
In its native, indigenous tongue.<br>
</p>

<p>
There'll be nothing but beauty, wealth, pleasure, <br>
With all things in order and measure.<br>
</p>

<p>
On the channels and streams <br>
See each vessel that dreams <br>
In its whimsical vagabond way, <br>
Since its for your least whim <br>
The oceans they swim <br>
From the ends of the night and the day. <br>
The sun, going down, With its glory will crown <br>
Canals, fields, and cities entire, <br>
While the whole earth is rolled <br>
In the jacinth and gold <br>
Of its warming and radiant fire.<br>
</p>

<p>
There'll be nothing but beauty, wealth, pleasure <br>
With all things in order and measure.<br>
</p>

<p>

<p>
<b>Invitation to the Voyage</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Think, would it not be<br>
Sweet to live with me<br>
All alone, my child, my love? &mdash; <br>
Sleep together, share<br>
All things, in that fair<br>
Country you remind me of? <br>
Charming in the dawn <br>
There, the half-withdrawn<br>
Drenched, mysterious sun appears <br>
In the curdled skies, <br>
Treacherous as your eyes<br>
Shining from behind their tears.<br>
</p>

<p>
There, restraint and order bless<br>
Luxury and voluptuousness.<br>
</p>

<p>
We should have a room <br>
Never out of bloom:<br>
Tables polished by the palm <br>
Of the vanished hours <br>
Should reflect rare flowers<br>
In that amber-scented calm;<br>
Ceilings richly wrought,<br>
Mirrors deep as thought,<br>
Walls with eastern splendor hung,<br>
All should speak apart <br>
To the homesick heart<br>
In its own dear native tongue.<br>
</p>

<p>
There, restraint and order bless<br>
Luxury and voluptuousness.<br>
</p>

<p>
See, their voyage past,<br>
To their moorings fast,<br>
On the still canals asleep, <br>
These big ships; to bring <br>
You some trifling thing<br>
They have braved the furious deep.<br>
&mdash; Now the sun goes down,<br>
Tinting dyke and town,<br>
Field, canal, all things in sight,<br>
Hyacinth and gold;<br>
All that we behold<br>
Slumbers in its ruddy light.<br>
</p>

<p>
There, restraint and order bless<br>
Luxury and voluptuousness.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Edna St. Vincent Millay, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>

<p>
<b>Invitation to the Voyage</b> <br>
</p>

<p>
My child mistress/mother sister/dream<br>
How acceptable all things would be<br>
Were we to live in that land where<br>
The slow and the long, short and the strong<br>
</p>

<p>
Die in the dance of being less than one another<br>
In a perpetual summer of imageless desire.<br>
Flagellated and forgotten suns<br>
Drink in the step of my azure lost skies<br>
And move to mysterylessness our chemical miseries<br>
Within which the treadling eyes of indefiniteness<br>
Are no more than the tears of the damned.<br>
Take from my heart, a platinum measure<br>
Free of solitude's false grace<br>
And awkward adolescent pleasures.<br>
Here is the furniture<br>
That caresses the dust of the years<br>
And counts the wrinkled set into the brain<br>
On fingers that have made their own doom.<br>
Evil the eyes that look back at us in dreams,<br>
Evil the touch of the deaths that have not loved us<br>
Evil the sorrow which shelters itself from release<br>
And the evils accumulate<br>
Leaving us idle and alone<br>
Though an Eastern splendor,<br>
An Eastern hatred of the idea of loss<br>
Eddies in the river of slime<br>
That has not won us.<br>
Hidden from the waves in still canals<br>
We sit in a small boat that refuses<br>
To set forth.<br>
To satisfy need,<br>
To accommodate our need of forever,<br>
We sit in the boat<br>
And wait for a clearer sky,<br>
A more propitious moment to launch<br>
While thinking of Cortez'  <br>
Miraculous slaughter of and victory over<br>
The children of the sun.<br>
</p>

<p>
<b>Invitation to a Journey</b>
</p>

<p>
My sister, my dear <br>
Consider how fair, <br>
Together to live it would be! <br>
Down yonder to fly <br>
To love, till we die, <br>
In the land which resembles thee. <br>
Those suns that rise <br>
'Neath erratic skies, <br>
&mdash; No charm could be like unto theirs &mdash;<br>
So strange and divine, <br>
Like those eyes of thine <br>
Which glow in the midst of their tears. <br>
</p>

<p>
There, all is order and loveliness, <br>
Luxury, calm and voluptuousness. <br>
</p>

<p>
The tables and chairs, <br>
Polished bright by the years, <br>
Would decorate sweetly our rooms, <br>
And the rarest of flowers <br>
Would twine round our bowers <br>
And mingle their amber perfumes:<br>
The ceilings arrayed, <br>
And the mirrors inlaid, <br>
This Eastern splendour among, <br>
Would furtively steal <br>
O'er our skuls, and appeal <br>
With its tranquillous native tongue. <br>
</p>

<p>
There, all is order and loveliness, <br>
Luxury, calm and voluptuousness. <br>
</p>

<p>
In the harbours, peep, <br>
At the vessels asleep <br>
(Their humour is always to roam), <br>
Yet it is but to grant <br>
Thy smallest want <br>
From the ends of the earth that they come, <br>
The sunsets beam <br>
Upon meadow and stream, <br>
And upon the city entire <br>
'Neath a violet crest, <br>
The world sinks to rest, <br>
Illumed by a golden fire. <br>
</p>

<p>
There, all is order and loveliness, <br>
Luxury, calm and voluptuousness. <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Cyril Scott, <i>Baudelaire: The Flowers of Evil</i> (London: Elkin Mathews, 1909)

<br>

<p>
<b>The Invitation to the Voyage</b><br>
</p>

<p>
How sweet, my own, <br>
Could we live alone <br>
Over beyond the sea! <br>
To love and to die <br>
Indolently <br>
In the land that's akin to thee! <br>
Where the suns which rise <br>
In the watery skies <br>
Weave soft spells over my sight, <br>
As thy false eyes do <br>
When they flicker through <br>
Their tears with a dim, strange light. <br>
</p>

<p>
There all is beauty and symmetry, <br>
Pleasure and calm and luxury. <br>
</p>

<p>
Years that have gone <br>
Have polished and shone <br>
The things that would fill our room; <br>
The flowers most rare <br>
Which scent the air <br>
In the richly-ceiling'd gloom, <br>
And the mirrors profound, <br>
And the walls around <br>
With Orient splendour hung, <br>
To the soul would speak <br>
Of things she doth seek <br>
In her gentle native tongue. <br>
</p>

<p>
There all is beauty and symmetry, <br>
Pleasure and calm and luxury. <br>
</p>

<p>
The canals are deep <br>
Where the strange ships sleep <br>
Far from the land of their birth; <br>
To quench the fire <br>
Of thy least desire <br>
They have come from the ends of the earth. <br>
The sunsets drown <br>
Peaceful town <br>
And meadow, and stagnant stream <br>
In bistre and gold, <br>
And the world enfold <br>
In a warm and luminous dream. <br>
</p>

<p>
There all is beauty and symmetry, <br>
Pleasure and calm and luxury. <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jack Collings Squire, <i>Poems and Baudelaire Flowers</i> (London: The New Age Press, Ltd, 1909)<br>
