<b>&Agrave; Celle qui est trop gaie</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Ta t&ecirc;te, ton geste, ton air<br>
Sont beaux comme un beau paysage; <br>
Le rire joue en ton visage <br>
Comme un vent frais dans un ciel clair.<br>
</p>

<p>
Le passant chagrin que tu fr&ocirc;les <br>
Est &eacute;bloui par la sant&eacute; <br>
Qui jaillit comme une clart&eacute; <br>
De tes bras et de tes &eacute;paules.<br>
</p>

<p>
Les retentissantes couleurs <br>
Dont tu pars&egrave;mes tes toilettes <br>
Jettent dans l'esprit des po&egrave;tes <br>
L'image d'un ballet de fleurs.<br>
</p>

<p>
Ces robes folles sont l'embl&egrave;me <br>
De ton esprit bariol&eacute;; <br>
Folle dont je suis affol&eacute;, <br>
Je te hais autant que je t'aime!<br>
</p>

<p>
Quelquefois dans un beau jardin <br>
O&ugrave; je tra&icirc;nais mon atonie, <br>
J'ai senti, comme une ironie, <br>
Le soleil d&eacute;chirer mon sein,<br>
</p>

<p>
Et le printemps et la verdure <br>
Ont tant humili&eacute; mon coeur, <br>
Que j'ai puni sur une fleur <br>
L'insolence de la Nature.<br>
</p>

<p>
Ainsi je voudrais, une nuit, <br>
Quand l'heure des volupt&eacute;s sonne, <br>
Vers les tr&eacute;sors de ta personne, <br>
Comme un l&acirc;che, ramper sans bruit,<br>
</p>

<p>
Pour ch&acirc;tier ta chair joyeuse, <br>
Pour meurtrir ton sein pardonn&eacute;, <br>
Et faire &agrave; ton flanc &eacute;tonn&eacute; <br>
Une blessure large et creuse,<br>
</p>

<p>
Et, vertigineuse douceur! <br>
&Agrave; travers ces l&egrave;vres nouvelles, <br>
Plus &eacute;clatantes et plus belles, <br>
T'infuser mon venin, ma soeur!
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>To One Who Is Too Gay</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Your head, your bearing, your gestures <br>
Are fair as a fair countryside; <br>
Laughter plays on your face <br>
Like a cool wind in a clear sky.<br>
</p>

<p>
The gloomy passer-by you meet <br>
Is dazzled by the glow of health <br>
Which radiates resplendently <br>
From your arms and shoulders.<br>
</p>

<p>
The touches of sonorous color <br>
That you scatter on your dresses <br>
Cast into the minds of poets <br>
The image of a flower dance.<br>
</p>

<p>
Those crazy frocks are the emblem<br>
Of your multi-colored nature;<br>
Mad woman whom I'm mad about,<br>
I hate and love you equally!<br>
</p>

<p>
At times in a lovely garden <br>
Where I dragged my atony, <br>
I have felt the sun tear my breast, <br>
As though it were in mockery;<br>
</p>

<p>
Both the springtime and its verdure <br>
So mortified my heart <br>
That I punished a flower <br>
For the insolence of Nature.<br>
</p>

<p>
Thus I should like, some night,<br>
When the hour for pleasure sounds,<br>
To creep softly, like a coward,<br>
Toward the treasures of your body,<br>
</p>

<p>
To whip your joyous flesh<br>
And bruise your pardoned breast,<br>
To make in your astonished flank<br>
A wide and gaping wound,<br>
</p>

<p>
And, intoxicating sweetness!<br>
Through those new lips,<br>
More bright, more beautiful,<br>
To infuse my venom, my sister!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>To One Who Is Too Gay</b>
</p>

<p>
Your head, your gestures, and your air <br>
Are lovely as a landscape; smiles <br>
Rimple upon your face at whiles <br>
Like winds in the clear sky up there.<br>
</p>

<p>
The grumpy passers that you graze <br>
Are dazzled by the radiant health, <br>
And the illimitable wealth <br>
Your arms and shoulders seem to blaze.<br>
</p>

<p>
The glaring colours that, in showers, <br>
Clash in your clothes with such commotion, <br>
In poets' minds suggest the notion <br>
Of a mad ballet-dance of flowers.<br>
</p>

<p>
These garish dresses illustrate <br>
Your spirit, striped with every fad. <br>
O madwoman, whom, quite as mad, <br>
I love as madly as I hate.<br>
</p>

<p>
Sometimes in gardens, seeking rest, <br>
Where I have dragged my soul atonic, <br>
I've felt the sun with gaze ironic <br>
Tearing the heart within my breast.<br>
</p>

<p>
The spring and verdure, dressed to stagger, <br>
Humiliate me with such power <br>
That I have punished, in a flower, <br>
The insolence of Nature's swagger.<br>
</p>

<p>
And so, one night, I'd like to sneak, <br>
When night has tolled the hour of pleasure, <br>
A craven thief, towards the treasure <br>
Which is your person, plump and sleek.<br>
</p>

<p>
To punish your bombastic flesh, <br>
To bruise your breast immune to pain, <br>
To farrow down your flank a lane <br>
Of gaping crimson, deep and fresh.<br>
</p>

<p>
And, most vertiginous delight! <br>
Into those lips, so freshly striking <br>
And daily lovelier to my liking &mdash; <br>
Infuse the venom of my sprite.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>


<p>
<b>A Girl Too Gay</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Oh, you are lovely! Every heart <br>
Surrenders to your sorceries; <br>
And laughter, like a playful breeze, <br>
Is always blowing your lips apart.<br>
</p>

<p>
Your health is radiant, infinite,<br>
Superb: When you go down the street<br>
Each mournful passerby you meet<br>
Is dazzled by the blaze of it!<br>
</p>

<p>
Your startling dresses, overwrought <br>
With rainbow hues and sequined showers, <br>
Bring to a poet's mind the thought <br>
Of a ballet of drunken flowers.<br>
</p>

<p>
They are the very symbol of<br>
Your gay and crudely colored soul,<br>
As strip&egrave;d as a barber's pole,<br>
Exuberant thing I hate and love!<br>
</p>

<p>
Sometimes when wandering, full of gloom,<br>
In a bright garden, I have felt<br>
Horror for all I touched and smelt:<br>
The world outrageously in bloom,<br>
</p>

<p>
The blinding yellow sun, the spring's <br>
Raw verdure so rebuked my woes <br>
That I have punished upon a rose <br>
The insolence of flowering things.<br>
</p>

<p>
Likewise, some evening, I would creep,<br>
When midnight sounds, and everywhere<br>
The sighing of lovers fills the air,<br>
To the hushed alcove where you sleep,<br>
</p>

<p>
And waken you by violent storm,<br>
And beat you coldly till you swooned,<br>
And carve upon your perfect form,<br>
With care, a deep seductive wound &mdash; <br>
</p>

<p>
And (joy delirious and complete!) <br>
Through those bright novel lips, through this <br>
Gaudy and virgin orifice, <br>
Infuse you with my venom, sweet.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; George Dillon, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>To a Blithe Spirit</b>
</p>

<p>
The toss of your hair, your dancing eye,<br>
Are cheerful as a woodland place;<br>
And laughter plays across your face<br>
Like a fresh wind in a blue sky.<br>
</p>

<p>
The gloomy shadows you pass by<br>
Are brightened by your spirit’s lilt,<br>
You who are so free of guilt,<br>
Your shoulders never heave a sigh.<br>
</p>

<p>
Your rustling dresses’ spangled flowers<br>
Imitate all the garden’s hues,<br>
Re-weaving for a poet’s muse<br>
A light ballet of rainbowed showers.<br>
</p>

<p>
These gorgeous garments emblemize<br>
Your spirit’s whirling gaiety,<br>
An attitude so troubling me<br>
That where I love I must despise.<br>
</p>

<p>
Sometimes in misery I poke<br>
Along a rose-abundant plot:<br>
I feel the sun grown golden-hot<br>
And comprehend the stupid joke.<br>
</p>

<p>
Green hues across the countryside<br>
Have come as torture to my heart:<br>
And then I’ve torn a flower apart,<br>
To punish Nature for her pride.<br>
</p>

<p>
And so I would prepare to call<br>
Some night and, with a bitter smile,<br>
Come upon your flesh’s guile:<br>
Yes, darkly, coward-like I’d crawl,<br>
</p>

<p>
As in your heap of joy you sleep,<br>
To stab your spirit’s lovely lie:<br>
To slice upon your tender thigh<br>
A laceration, long and deep,<br>
</p>

<p>
(The gritty sweetness of it all!)<br>
And as those oozing lips so spread,<br>
Sensationally, madly red,<br>
In you, dear sister, spit my gall!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Edward Eriksson
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>&Agrave; Celle Qui Est Trop Gaie</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Your head, your stance, your airy grace <br>
Are as a landscape in July, <br>
Blithe laughter plays upon your face <br>
Like a cool wind in a clear sky.<br>
</p>

<p>
The sorry passerby you sight <br>
Is dazzled by the glowing charms <br>
That issue in a radiant light <br>
Over your shoulders and your arms. <br>
</p>

<p>
Over your blaring frocks we find <br>
Wild colors strewn with elegance <br>
That rouse within the poet's mind <br>
The image of a flower dance. <br>
</p>

<p>
Your crazy gowns are emblems of <br>
Your own variegated state, <br>
Madwoman, whom I madly love <br>
And whom I quite as madly hate. <br>
</p>

<p>
At times in gardens where, oppressed, <br>
I dragged my stubborn atony, <br>
I felt gold sunlight rend my breast <br>
As if in bitter raillery. <br>
</p>

<p>
Both springtime and its verdant bowers <br>
So mortified my heart and sense <br>
That I chastised the budding flowers <br>
Because of Nature's insolence. <br>
</p>

<p>
Thus I should like some night, when deep <br>
The hour tolls out for hidden pleasures, <br>
Softly and cravenly to creep <br>
Close to your body's lavish treasures.<br>
</p>

<p>
(Last two stanzas cut off &mdash; censored? &mdash; in original publication.)

<p>
&mdash; Jacques LeClercq, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (Mt Vernon, NY: Peter Pauper Press, 1958)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>To Her Who Is Too Gay</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Your head, your gesture, your air<br>
Are beautiful as a beautiful landscape; <br>
The smile plays in your face <br>
Like a fresh wind in a clear sky.<br>
</p>

<p>
The fleeting care that you brush against <br>
Is dazzled by the health <br>
Which leaps like clarity <br>
From your arms and your shoulders.<br>
</p>

<p>
The re-echoing colors <br>
Which you scatter in your toilet <br>
Cast in the hearts of poets <br>
The image of a ballet of flowers.<br>
</p>

<p>
These silly clothes are the emblem<br>
Of your many-colored spirit;<br>
Silly woman of my infatuation,<br>
I hate as much as love you!<br>
</p>

<p>
Sometimes in a pretty garden <br>
Where I dragged my weakness, <br>
I have felt the sun like irony <br>
Tear my chest;<br>
</p>

<p>
And the spring and the green of things <br>
Have so humbled my heart, <br>
That I have punished a flower <br>
For the insolence of Nature.<br>
</p>

<p>
Thus I would wish, one night,<br>
When the voluptuary's hour sounds,<br>
To crawl like a coward, noiselessly,<br>
Towards the treasures of your body,<br>
</p>

<p>
In order to correct your gay flesh<br>
And beat your unbegrudging breast,<br>
To make upon your starting thigh<br>
A long and biting weal,<br>
</p>

<p>
And, sweet giddiness,<br>
Along those newly-gaping lips<br>
More vivid and more beautiful,<br>
Inject my venom, O my sister!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Geoffrey Wagner, <i>Selected Poems of Charles Baudelaire</i> (NY: Grove Press, 1974) <br>
