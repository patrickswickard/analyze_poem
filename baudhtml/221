<b>Les Sept vieillards</b><br>
</p>


<p>
<i>&Agrave; Victor Hugo</i><br>
</p>

<p>
Fourmillante cit&eacute;, cit&eacute; pleine de r&ecirc;ves,<br>
O&ugrave; le spectre en plein jour raccroche le passant!<br>
Les myst&egrave;res partout coulent comme des s&egrave;ves<br>
Dans les canaux &eacute;troits du colosse puissant.<br>
</p>

<p>
Un matin, cependant que dans la triste rue<br>
Les maisons, dont la brume allongeait la hauteur,<br>
Simulaient les deux quais d'une rivi&egrave;re accrue,<br>
Et que, d&eacute;cor semblable &agrave; l'&acirc;me de l'acteur,<br>
</p>

<p>
Un brouillard sale et jaune inondait tout l'espace,<br>
Je suivais, roidissant mes nerfs comme un h&eacute;ros<br>
Et discutant avec mon &acirc;me d&eacute;j&agrave; lasse,<br>
Le faubourg secou&eacute; par les lourds tombereaux.<br>
</p>

<p>
Tout &agrave; coup, un vieillard dont les guenilles jaunes<br>
Imitaient la couleur de ce ciel pluvieux,<br>
Et dont l'aspect aurait fait pleuvoir les aum&ocirc;nes,<br>
Sans la m&eacute;chancet&eacute; qui luisait dans ses yeux,<br>
</p>

<p>
M'apparut. On e&ucirc;t dit sa prunelle tremp&eacute;e<br>
Dans le fiel; son regard aiguisait les frimas,<br>
Et sa barbe &agrave; longs poils, roide comme une &eacute;p&eacute;e,<br>
Se projetait, pareille &agrave; celle de Judas.<br>
</p>

<p>
II n'&eacute;tait pas vo&ucirc;t&eacute;, mais cass&eacute;, son &eacute;chine<br>
Faisant avec sa jambe un parfait angle droit,<br>
Si bien que son b&acirc;ton, parachevant sa mine,<br>
Lui donnait la tournure et le pas maladroit<br>
</p>

<p>
D'un quadrup&egrave;de infirme ou d'un juif &agrave; trois pattes.<br>
Dans la neige et la boue il allait s'emp&ecirc;trant,<br>
Comme s'il &eacute;crasait des morts sous ses savates,<br>
Hostile &agrave; l'univers plut&ocirc;t qu'indiff&eacute;rent.<br>
</p>

<p>
Son pareil le suivait: barbe, oeil, dos, b&acirc;ton, loques,<br>
Nul trait ne distinguait, du m&ecirc;me enfer venu,<br>
Ce jumeau centenaire, et ces spectres baroques<br>
Marchaient du m&ecirc;me pas vers un but inconnu.<br>
</p>

<p>
&Agrave; quel complot inf&acirc;me &eacute;tais-je donc en butte,<br>
Ou quel m&eacute;chant hasard ainsi m'humiliait?<br>
Car je comptai sept fois, de minute en minute,<br>
Ce sinistre vieillard qui se multipliait!<br>
</p>

<p>
Que celui-l&agrave; qui rit de mon inqui&eacute;tude<br>
Et qui n'est pas saisi d'un frisson fraternel<br>
Songe bien que malgr&eacute; tant de d&eacute;cr&eacute;pitude<br>
Ces sept monstres hideux avaient l'air &eacute;ternel!<br>
</p>

<p>
Aurais-je, sans mourir, contempl&eacute; le huiti&egrave;me,<br>
Sosie inexorable, ironique et fatal<br>
D&eacute;go&ucirc;tant Ph&eacute;nix, fils et p&egrave;re de lui-m&ecirc;me?<br>
&mdash; Mais je tournai le dos au cort&egrave;ge infernal.<br>
</p>

<p>
Exasp&eacute;r&eacute; comme un ivrogne qui voit double,<br>
Je rentrai, je fermai ma porte, &eacute;pouvant&eacute;,<br>
Malade et morfondu, l'esprit fi&eacute;vreux et trouble,<br>
Bless&eacute; par le myst&egrave;re et par l'absurdit&eacute;!<br>
</p>

<p>
Vainement ma raison voulait prendre la barre;<br>
La temp&ecirc;te en jouant d&eacute;routait ses efforts,<br>
Et mon &acirc;me dansait, dansait, vieille gabarre<br>
Sans m&acirc;ts, sur une mer monstrueuse et sans bords!<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>The Seven Old Men</b><br>
</p>

<p>
To Victor Hugo<br>
</p>

<p>
Teeming, swarming city, city full of dreams, <br>
Where specters in broad day accost the passer-by! <br>
Everywhere mysteries flow like the sap in a tree <br>
Through the narrow canals of the mighty giant.<br>
</p>

<p>
One morning, while in a gloomy street the houses,<br>
Whose height was increased by the mist, simulated<br>
The quais of a swollen river, and while<br>
&mdash; A setting that was like the actor's soul &mdash; <br>
</p>

<p>
A dirty yellow fog inundated all space, <br>
I was following, steeling my nerves like a hero, <br>
Arid arguing with my already weary soul, <br>
A squalid street shaken by the heavy dump-carts.<br>
</p>

<p>
Suddenly an old man whose tattered yellow clothes<br>
Were of the same color as the rainy heavens,<br>
And whose aspect would have brought him showers of alms<br>
If his eyes had not gleamed with so much wickedness,<br>
</p>

<p>
Appeared to me. One would have said his eyes were drenched <br>
With gall; his look sharpened the winter's chill, <br>
And his long shaggy beard, like that of Judas, <br>
Projected from his chin as stiffly as a sword.<br>
</p>

<p>
He was not bent over, but broken; his back-bone<br>
Made with his legs a perfect right angle,<br>
So that his stick, completing the picture,<br>
Gave him the appearance and clumsy gait<br>
</p>

<p>
Of a lame quadruped or a three-legged Jew.<br>
He went hobbling along in the snow and the mud<br>
As if he were crushing the dead under his shoes;<br>
Hostile, rather than indifferent to the world,<br>
</p>

<p>
His likeness followed him: beard, eye, back, stick, tatters, <br>
No mark distinguished this centenarian twin, <br>
Who came from the same hell, and these baroque specters <br>
Were walking with the same gait toward an unknown goal.<br>
</p>

<p>
Of what infamous plot was I then the object, <br>
Or what evil chance humiliated me thus? <br>
For I counted seven times in as many minutes <br>
That sinister old man who multiplied himself!<br>
</p>

<p>
Let him who laughs at my disquietude, <br>
And who is not seized with a fraternal shudder, <br>
Realize that in spite of such decrepitude <br>
Those hideous monsters had an eternal look!<br>
</p>

<p>
Could I, without dying, have regarded the eighth, <br>
Unrelenting Sosia, ironic and fatal, <br>
Disgusting Phoenix, son and father of himself?<br>
&mdash; But I turned my back on that hellish procession.<br>
</p>

<p>
Exasperated like a drunk who sees double, <br>
I went home; I locked the door, terrified, <br>
Chilled to the bone and ill, my mind fevered, confused, <br>
Hurt by that mysterious and absurd happening!<br>
</p>

<p>
Vainly my reason tried to take the helm;<br>
The frolicsome tempest baffled all its efforts,<br>
And my soul, old sailing barge without masts,<br>
Kept dancing, dancing, on a monstrous, shoreless sea!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Seven Old Men</b>
</p>

<p>
To Victor Hugo<br>
</p>

<p>
Ant-seething city, city full of dreams, <br>
Where ghosts by daylight tug the passer's sleeve. <br>
Mystery, like sap, through all its conduit-streams, <br>
Quickens the dread Colossus that they weave.<br>
</p>

<p>
One early morning, in the street's sad mud,<br>
Whose houses, by the fog increased in height,<br>
Seemed wharves along a riverside in flood:<br>
When with a scene to match the actor's plight,<br>
</p>

<p>
Foul yellow mist had filled the whole of space: <br>
Steeling my nerves to play a hero's part, <br>
I coaxed my weary soul with me to pace <br>
The backstreets shaken by each lumbering cart.<br>
</p>

<p>
A wretch appeared whose tattered, yellow clothing, <br>
Matching the colour of the raining skies, <br>
Could make it shower down alms &mdash; but for the loathing <br>
Malevolence that glittered in his eyes.<br>
</p>

<p>
The pupils of his eyes, with bile injected, <br>
Seemed with their glance to make the frost more raw. <br>
Stiff as a sword, his long red beard projected, <br>
Like that of Judas, level with his jaw.<br>
</p>

<p>
He was not bent, but broken, with the spine<br>
Forming a sharp right-angle to the straight,<br>
So that his stick, to finish the design,<br>
Gave him the stature and the crazy gait<br>
</p>

<p>
Of a three-footed Jew, or crippled hound. <br>
He plunged his soles into the slush as though <br>
To crush the dead; and to the world around <br>
Seemed less of an indifferent than a foe.<br>
</p>

<p>
His image followed him, (back, stick, and beard <br>
In nothing differed) spawned from the same hole, <br>
A centenarian twin. Both spectres steered <br>
With the same gait to the same unknown goal.<br>
</p>

<p>
To what foul plot was I exposed? of what <br>
Humiliating hazard made the jeer? <br>
For seven times, (I counted) was begot <br>
This sinister, self multiplying fear!<br>
</p>

<p>
Let him mark well who laughs at my despair <br>
With no fraternal shudder in reply...<br>
Those seven loathsome monsters had the air, <br>
Though rotting through, of what can never die.<br>
</p>

<p>
Disgusting Phoenix, his own sire and father! <br>
Could I have watched an eighth instalment spawn <br>
Ironic, fateful, grim &mdash; nor perished rather? <br>
But from that hellish cortege I'd withdrawn.<br>
</p>

<p>
Perplexed as drunkards when their sight is doubled, <br>
I locked my room, sick, fevered, chilled with fright:<br>
With all my spirit sorely hurt and troubled <br>
By so ridiculous yet strange a sight.<br>
</p>

<p>
Vainly my reason for the helm was striving: <br>
The tempest of my efforts made a scorn. <br>
My soul like a dismasted wreck went driving <br>
Over a monstrous sea without a bourn.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Seven Old Men</b><br>
</p>

<p>
City swarming with people, how full you are of dreams! <br>
Here in broad daylight, surely, the passerby may meet <br>
A specter, &mdash; be accosted by him! Mystery seems <br>
To move like a thick sap through every narrow street.<br>
</p>

<p>
I thought (daybreak, it was, in a sad part of town) <br>
"These houses look much higher in the fog!" &mdash; they stood <br>
Like two gray quays between which a muddy stream flows down; <br>
The setting of the play matched well the actor's mood.<br>
</p>

<p>
All space became a dirty yellow fog; I tried <br>
To fight it off; I railed at my poor soul, whose feet, <br>
Weary already, dragged and stumbled at my side. <br>
Big wagons, bound for market, began to shake the street.<br>
</p>

<p>
Suddenly there beside me an old man &mdash; all in holes<br>
His garments were, and yellow, like the murky skies,<br>
A sight to wring a rain of coins from kindly souls,<br>
Save for a certain malice gleaming in his eyes,<br>
</p>

<p>
Appeared. You would have said those eyeballs, without doubt, <br>
Were steeped in bile &mdash; they sharpened the sleet they looked upon. <br>
His beard, with its long hairs, stiff as a sword stood out <br>
Before him, as the beard of Judas must have done.<br>
</p>

<p>
He stooped so when he walked, his spine seemed not so much<br>
Bending as broken, &mdash; truly, his leg with his backbone<br>
Made a right angle; and his stick, the finishing touch,<br>
Gave him the awkward gait &mdash; now rearing, now half-thrown &mdash; <br>
</p>

<p>
Of a three-legged Jew, or some lame quadruped. <br>
It crossed my mind, as through the mud and snow he went, <br>
"He walks like someone crushing the faces of the dead. <br>
Hostile, that's what he is; he's not indifferent."<br>
</p>

<p>
A man exactly like him followed him. From beard <br>
To stick they were the same, had risen from the same hell. <br>
These centenarian twins kept step in rhythmic weird <br>
Precision, toward some goal which doubtless they knew well.<br>
</p>

<p>
"What ugly game is this?" I said; "what horseplay's here? <br>
Am I the butt of knaves, or have I lost my mind?" <br>
For seven times &mdash; I counted them &mdash; there did appear <br>
This sinister form, which passed, yet left itself behind.<br>
</p>

<p>
Let anyone who smiles at my distress, whose heart<br>
No sympathetic horror grips, consider well:<br>
Though these old monsters seemed about to fall apart,<br>
Somehow I knew they were eternal, &mdash; l could tell!<br>
</p>

<p>
Had I beheld one more of them, I think indeed <br>
I should have died! &mdash; for each, in some disgusting way, <br>
Had spawned himself, lewd Phoenix, from his own foul seed, <br>
Was his own son and father, &mdash; I fled &mdash; I could not stay.<br>
</p>

<p>
Angry, bewildered, like a drunken man by whom<br>
All objects are seen double, I locked my door, and heard<br>
My frozen heart cry out with dread in the hot room, &mdash; <br>
That what was so mysterious should be so absurd!<br>
</p>

<p>
My reason fought to gain the bridge and take the helm; <br>
The tempest thrust it back; and rudderless, unrigged, <br>
A hull which the waves wash but will not overwhelm, <br>
My soul upon a shoreless sea of horror jigged.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Edna St. Vincent Millay, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>

<p>
<b>The Seven Old Men</b>
</p>

<p>
O swarming city, city full of dreams,<br>
Where in full day the spectre walks and speaks;<br>
Mighty colossus, in your narrow veins<br>
My story flows as flows the rising sap.<br>
</p>

<p>
One morn, disputing with my tired soul,<br>
And like a hero stiffening all my nerves,<br>
I trod a suburb shaken by the jar<br>
Of rolling wheels, where the fog magnified<br>
The houses either side of that sad street,<br>
So they seemed like two wharves the ebbing flood<br>
Leaves desolate by the river-side. A mist,<br>
Unclean and yellow, inundated space &mdash; <br>
A scene that would have pleased an actor's soul.<br>
Then suddenly an aged man, whose rags<br>
Were yellow as the rainy sky, whose looks<br>
Should have brought alms in floods upon his head.<br>
Without the misery gleaming in his eye,<br>
Appeared before me; and his pupils seemed<br>
To have been washed with gall; the bitter frost<br>
Sharpened his glance; and from his chin a beard<br>
Sword-stiff and ragged, Judas-like stuck forth.<br>
He was not bent but broken: his backbone<br>
Made a so true right angle with his legs,<br>
That, as he walked, the tapping stick which gave<br>
The finish to the picture, made him seem<br>
Like some infirm and stumbling quadruped<br>
Or a three-legged Jew. Through snow and mud<br>
He walked with troubled and uncertain gait,<br>
As though his sabots trod upon the dead,<br>
Indifferent and hostile to the world.<br>
</p>

<p>
His double followed him: tatters and stick<br>
And back and eye and beard, all were the same;<br>
Out of the same Hell, indistinguishable,<br>
These centenarian twins, these spectres odd,<br>
Trod the same pace toward some end unknown.<br>
To what fell complot was I then exposed?<br>
Humiliated by what evil chance?<br>
For as the minutes one by one went by<br>
Seven times I saw this sinister old man<br>
Repeat his image there before my eyes!<br>
</p>

<p>
Let him who smiles at my inquietude,<br>
Who never trembled at a fear like mine,<br>
Know that in their decrepitude's despite<br>
These seven old hideous monsters had the mien<br>
Of beings immortal.<br>
</p>

<p>
Then, I thought, must I,<br>
Undying, contemplate the awful eighth;<br>
Inexorable, fatal, and ironic double;<br>
Disgusting Phœnix, father of himself<br>
And his own son? In terror then I turned<br>
My back upon the infernal band, and fled<br>
To my own place, and closed my door; distraught<br>
And like a drunkard who sees all things twice,<br>
With feverish troubled spirit, chilly and sick,<br>
Wounded by mystery and absurdity!<br>
</p>

<p>
In vain my reason tried to cross the bar,<br>
The whirling storm but drove her back again;<br>
And my soul tossed, and tossed, an outworn wreck,<br>
Mastless, upon a monstrous, shoreless sea.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; F.P. Sturm, from <i>Baudelaire: His Prose and Poetry</i>, edited by Thomas Robert Smith (New York: Boni and Liveright, 1919)
