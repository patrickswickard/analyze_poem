<b>Ch&acirc;timent de l'orgueil</b><br>
</p>

<p>
En ces temps merveilleux o&ugrave; la Th&eacute;ologie<br>
Fleurit avec le plus de s&egrave;ve et d'&eacute;nergie,<br>
On raconte qu'un jour un docteur des plus grands,<br>
&mdash; Apr&egrave;s avoir forc&eacute; les coeurs indiff&eacute;rents;<br>
Les avoir remu&eacute;s dans leurs profondeurs noires;<br>
Apr&egrave;s avoir franchi vers les c&eacute;lestes gloires<br>
Des chemins singuliers &agrave; lui-m&ecirc;me inconnus,<br>
O&ugrave; les purs Esprits seuls peut-&ecirc;tre &eacute;taient venus, &mdash; <br>
Comme un homme mont&eacute; trop haut, pris de panique,<br>
S'&eacute;cria, transport&eacute; d'un orgueil satanique:<br>
&laquo;J&eacute;sus, petit J&eacute;sus! je t'ai pouss&eacute; bien haut!<br>
Mais, si j'avais voulu t'attaquer au d&eacute;faut<br>
De l'armure, ta honte &eacute;galerait ta gloire,<br>
Et tu ne serais plus qu'un foetus d&eacute;risoire!&raquo;<br>
</p>

<p>
Imm&eacute;diatement sa raison s'en alla.<br>
L'&eacute;clat de ce soleil d'un cr&ecirc;pe se voila<br>
Tout le chaos roula dans cette intelligence,<br>
Temple autrefois vivant, plein d'ordre et d'opulence,<br>
Sous les plafonds duquel tant de pompe avait lui.<br>
Le silence et la nuit s'install&egrave;rent en lui,<br>
Comme dans un caveau dont la clef est perdue.<br>
D&egrave;s lors il fut semblable aux b&ecirc;tes de la rue,<br>
Et, quand il s'en allait sans rien voir, &agrave; travers<br>
Les champs, sans distinguer les &eacute;t&eacute;s des hivers,<br>
Sale, inutile et laid comme une chose us&eacute;e,<br>
Il faisait des enfants la joie et la ris&eacute;e.<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>Punishment for Pride</b><br>
</p>

<p>
In that marvelous time in which Theology<br>
Flourished with the greatest energy and vigor,<br>
It is said that one day a most learned doctor<br>
&mdash; After winning by force the indifferent hearts,<br>
Having stirred them in the dark depths of their being;<br>
After crossing on the way to celestial glory,<br>
Singular and strange roads, even to him unknown,<br>
Which only pure Spirits, perhaps, had reached, &mdash; <br>
Panic-stricken, like one who has clambered too high,<br>
He cried, carried away by a satanic pride:<br>
"Jesus, little jesus! I raised you very high!<br>
But had I wished to attack you through the defect<br>
In your armor, your shame would equal your glory,<br>
And you would be no more than a despised fetus!"<br>
</p>

<p>
At that very moment his reason departed. <br>
A crape of mourning veiled the brilliance of that sun; <br>
Complete chaos rolled in and filled that intellect, <br>
A temple once alive, ordered and opulent, <br>
Within whose walls so much pomp had glittered. <br>
Silence and darkness took possession of it <br>
Like a cellar to which the key is lost.<br>
</p>

<p>
Henceforth he was like the beasts in the street, <br>
And when he went along, seeing nothing, across <br>
The fields, distinguishing nor summer nor winter, <br>
Dirty, useless, ugly, like a discarded thing, <br>
He was the laughing-stock, the joke, of the children.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>

<p>
<b>The Punishment of Pride</b>
</p>

<p>
When first Theology in her young prime <br>
Flourished with vigour, in that wondrous time, <br>
Of an illustrious Doctor it was said <br>
That, having forced indifferent hearts to shed <br>
Tears of emotion, moved to depths profound: <br>
And having to celestial glory found <br>
Marvellous paths, to his own self unknown, <br>
Where only purest souls had fared alone &mdash; <br>
Like a man raised too high, as in a panic, <br>
Crazed with a vertigo of pride satanic, <br>
He cried "Poor Christ, I've raised you to renown!<br>
But had I wished to bring you crashing down <br>
Probing your flaws, your shame would match your pride <br>
And you'd be but a foetus to deride!"<br>
</p>

<p>
Immediately he felt his wits escape, <br>
That flash of sunlight veiled itself in crepe. <br>
All chaos through his intellect was rolled, <br>
A temple once, containing hoards of gold, <br>
By opulence and order well controlled, <br>
And topped with ceilings splendid to behold. <br>
Silence and night installed their reign in him. <br>
It seemed he was a cellar dank and dim, <br>
To which no living man could find the key; <br>
And from that day a very beast was he. <br>
And while he wandered senseless on his way, <br>
Not knowing spring from summer, night from day, <br>
Foul, dirty, useless, and with no hereafter, <br>
He served the children as a butt for laughter.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>

<p>
<b>The Punishment of Pride</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Once in that marvelous and unremembered time<br>
When theologic thought was flowering at its prime,<br>
A pious metaphysician, the pundit of his day,<br>
He who could move the hearts of murderers, so they say,<br>
Having attained to a most fearful pitch of grace<br>
By curious pathways he himself could scarcely trace,<br>
For all his subtlety of logic &mdash; this austere<br>
And venerable person (like one who climbs a sheer<br>
Peak unperturbed, but at the top grows dizzy) cried,<br>
Suddenly overtaken with satanic pride:<br>
"Jesus, my little Jesus! I have exalted you<br>
Into a very Titan &mdash; yet wielding as I do<br>
The wand of dialectic, I could have made you shrink<br>
To fetus-like proportions and fade away, I think!"<br>
</p>

<p>
He thought no more, for instantly his reason cracked. <br>
The noontide of this great intelligence was blacked <br>
Out. Elemental chaos rolled through this serene <br>
Temple, where so much order and opulence had been. <br>
From its gold floor to its groined ceiling it grew dim: <br>
Silence and utter night installed themselves in him, <br>
As in an antique dungeon whereof the key is lost.<br>
And from that day, through rain and snow, through sleet and frost, <br>
Not knowing spring from winter and too mad to care, <br>
He roamed about gesticulating, with the air <br>
Of an old suit of underclothes hung out to dry, <br>
And made the children laugh whenever he went by.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; George Dillon, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>
</p>

<p>
<b>The Chastisement of Pride</b><br>
</p>

<p>
In those old times wherein Theology <br>
Flourished with greater sap and energy, <br>
A celebrated doctor &mdash; so they say &mdash; <br>
Having stirred many careless hearts one day <br>
Down to their dullest depths, and having shown <br>
Strange pathways leading to the heavenly throne &mdash; <br>
Tracks he himself had never journeyed on <br>
(Whereby maybe pure spirits alone had gone) &mdash; <br>
Frenzied and swollen by a devilish pride, <br>
Like to a man who has climbed too high, outcried: <br>
"Ah, little Jesus, I have lifted thee! <br>
But had I willed to assault thy dignity, <br>
Thy shame had matched thy present fame, and lo! <br>
Thou wouldst be but a wretched embryo!"<br>
</p>

<p>
Straightway his reason left him; that keen mind, <br>
Sunbright before, was darkened and made blind; <br>
All chaos whirled within that intellect <br>
Erewhile a shrine with all fair gems bedeckt. <br>
Beneath whose roof such pomp had shone so bright; <br>
He was possessed by silence and thick night <br>
As is a cellar when its key is lost <br>
</p>

<p>
Thenceforth he was a brute beast; when he crossed <br>
The fields at times, not seeing any thing. <br>
Knowing not if 'twere winter or green spring, <br>
Useless, repulsive, vile, he made a mock <br>
For infants, a mere children's laughing-stock. <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jack Collings Squire, <i>Poems and Baudelaire Flowers</i> (London: The New Age Press, Ltd, 1909)<br>
