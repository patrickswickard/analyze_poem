<b>Une Martyre</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Dessin d'un Ma&icirc;tre inconnu<br>
</p>

<p>
Au milieu des flacons, des &eacute;toffes lam&eacute;es<br>
Et des meubles voluptueux,<br>
Des marbres, des tableaux, des robes parfum&eacute;es<br>
Qui tra&icirc;nent &agrave; plis somptueux,<br>
</p>

<p>
Dans une chambre ti&egrave;de o&ugrave;, comme en une serre,<br>
L'air est dangereux et fatal,<br>
O&ugrave; des bouquets mourants dans leurs cercueils de verre<br>
Exhalent leur soupir final,<br>
</p>

<p>
Un cadavre sans t&ecirc;te &eacute;panche, comme un fleuve,<br>
Sur l'oreiller d&eacute;salt&eacute;r&eacute;<br>
Un sang rouge et vivant, dont la toile s'abreuve<br>
Avec l'avidit&eacute; d'un pr&eacute;.<br>
</p>

<p>
Semblable aux visions p&acirc;les qu'enfante l'ombre<br>
Et qui nous encha&icirc;nent les yeux,<br>
La t&ecirc;te, avec l'amas de sa crini&egrave;re sombre<br>
Et de ses bijoux pr&eacute;cieux,<br>
</p>

<p>
Sur la table de nuit, comme une renoncule,<br>
Repose; et, vide de pensers,<br>
Un regard vague et blanc comme le cr&eacute;puscule<br>
S'&eacute;chappe des yeux r&eacute;vuls&eacute;s.<br>
</p>

<p>
Sur le lit, le tronc nu sans scrupules &eacute;tale<br>
Dans le plus complet abandon<br>
La secr&egrave;te splendeur et la beaut&eacute; fatale<br>
Dont la nature lui fit don;<br>
</p>

<p>
Un bas ros&acirc;tre, orn&eacute; de coins d'or, &agrave; la jambe,<br>
Comme un souvenir est rest&eacute;;<br>
La jarreti&egrave;re, ainsi qu'un oeil secret qui flambe,<br>
Darde un regard diamant&eacute;.<br>
</p>

<p>
Le singulier aspect de cette solitude<br>
Et d'un grand portrait langoureux,<br>
Aux yeux provocateurs comme son attitude,<br>
R&eacute;v&egrave;le un amour t&eacute;n&eacute;breux,<br>
</p>

<p>
Une coupable joie et des f&ecirc;tes &eacute;tranges<br>
Pleines de baisers infernaux,<br>
Dont se r&eacute;jouissait l'essaim des mauvais anges<br>
Nageant dans les plis des rideaux;<br>
</p>

<p>
Et cependant, &agrave; voir la maigreur &eacute;l&eacute;gante<br>
De l'&eacute;paule au contour heurt&eacute;,<br>
La hanche un peu pointue et la taille fringante<br>
Ainsi qu'un reptile irrit&eacute;,<br>
</p>

<p>
Elle est bien jeune encor! &mdash; Son &acirc;me exasp&eacute;r&eacute;e<br>
Et ses sens par l'ennui mordus<br>
S'&eacute;taient-ils entr'ouverts &agrave; la meute alt&eacute;r&eacute;e<br>
Des d&eacute;sirs errants et perdus?<br>
</p>

<p>
L'homme vindicatif que tu n'as pu, vivante,<br>
Malgr&eacute; tant d'amour, assouvir,<br>
Combla-t-il sur ta chair inerte et complaisante<br>
L'immensit&eacute; de son d&eacute;sir?<br>
</p>

<p>
R&eacute;ponds, cadavre impur! et par tes tresses roides<br>
Te soulevant d'un bras fi&eacute;vreux,<br>
Dis-moi, t&ecirc;te effrayante, a-t-il sur tes dents froides<br>
Coll&eacute; les supr&ecirc;mes adieux?<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Loin du monde railleur, loin de la foule impure,<br>
Loin des magistrats curieux,<br>
Dors en paix, dors en paix, &eacute;trange cr&eacute;ature,<br>
Dans ton tombeau myst&eacute;rieux;<br>
</p>

<p>
Ton &eacute;poux court le monde, et ta forme immortelle<br>
Veille pr&egrave;s de lui quand il dort;<br>
Autant que toi sans doute il te sera fid&egrave;le,<br>
Et constant jusques &agrave; la mort.<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>A Martyr</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Drawing by an unknown master<br>
</p>

<p>
In the midst of perfume flasks, of sequined fabrics <br>
And voluptuous furniture,<br>
Of marble statues, pictures, and perfumed dresses <br>
That trail in sumptuous folds,<br>
</p>

<p>
In a warm room where, as in a hothouse, <br>
The air is dangerous, fatal,<br>
Where bouquets dying in their glass coffins <br>
Exhale their final breath,<br>
</p>

<p>
A headless cadaver pours out, like a river, <br>
On the saturated pillow<br>
Red, living blood, that the linen drinks up <br>
As greedily as a meadow.<br>
</p>

<p>
Like the pale visions engendered by shadows<br>
And which hold our eyes riveted,<br>
The head, its mane of hair piled up in a dark mass <br>
And wearing precious jewels,<br>
</p>

<p>
On the bedside table, like a ranunculus,<br>
Reposes; and, empty of thoughts,<br>
A stare, blank and pallid as the dawn,<br>
Escapes from the upturned eyeballs.<br>
</p>

<p>
On the bed, the nude torso shamelessly displays<br>
With the most complete abandon<br>
The secret splendor and fatal beauty<br>
That nature had bestowed on her;<br>
</p>

<p>
A rose stocking embroidered with gold clocks remains<br>
On her leg like a souvenir;<br>
The garter, like a hidden flashing eye,<br>
Darts its glance of diamond brilliance.<br>
</p>

<p>
The bizarre aspect of that solitude<br>
And of a large, languid portrait<br>
With eyes as provocative as the pose,<br>
Reveals an unwholesome love,<br>
</p>

<p>
Guilty joys and exotic revelries,<br>
With infernal kisses<br>
That delighted the swarm of bad angels<br>
Hovering in the curtains' folds;<br>
</p>

<p>
And yet one sees from the graceful slimness<br>
Of the angular shoulders.<br>
The haunches slightly sharp, and the waist sinuous<br>
As a snake poised to strike,<br>
</p>

<p>
That she's still quite young! &mdash; Had her exasperated soul <br>
And her senses gnawed by ennui<br>
Thrown open their gates to the thirsty pack <br>
Of lost and wandering desires?<br>
</p>

<p>
The vengeful man whom you could not with all your love <br>
Satisfy when you were alive,<br>
Did he use your inert, complacent flesh to fill <br>
The immensity of his lust?<br>
</p>

<p>
Reply, impure cadaver! and by your stiffened tresses <br>
Raising you with a fevered arm,<br>
Tell me, ghastly head, did he glue on your cold teeth <br>
The kisses of the last farewell?<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Far from the sneering world, far from the impure crowd, <br>
Far from curious magistrates,<br>
Sleep in peace, sleep in peace, bizarre creature, <br>
In your mysterious tomb;<br>
</p>

<p>
Your mate roams o'er the world, and your immortal form <br>
Watches over him when he sleeps;<br>
Even as you, he will doubtless be faithful <br>
And constant until death.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Martyr</b>
</p>

<p>
(Drawing by an Unknown Master)<br>
</p>

<p>
Amongst gilt fabrics, flasks of scent and wine,<br>
Rich furniture, white marble, precious moulds.<br>
Fine paintings, and rich, perfumed robes that shine<br>
Swirled into sumptuous folds,<br>
</p>

<p>
In a warm room, that like a hot-house stifles<br>
With dangerous and fatal breath, where lie<br>
Pale flowers in crystal tombs, exquisite trifles,<br>
Exhaling their last sigh &mdash; <br>
</p>

<p>
A headless corpse, cascading in a flood <br>
Hot, living blood, that soaks, with crimson stain <br>
A pillow slaked and sated with blood <br>
As any field with rain.<br>
</p>

<p>
Like those pale visions which the gloom aborts<br>
Which fix us in a still, hypnotic stare,<br>
The bead, tricked out with gems of sorts,<br>
In its huge mass of hair,<br>
</p>

<p>
Like a ranunculous beside the bed, <br>
Rests on the table, empty of all thought. <br>
From eyes revulsed, like twilight, seems to spread <br>
A gaze that looks at naught.<br>
</p>

<p>
Upon the bed the carcase, unabashed, <br>
Shows, in complete abandon, without shift, <br>
The secret splendour that, in life, it flashed <br>
Superbly, Nature's gift.<br>
</p>

<p>
A rosy stocking, freaked with clocks of gold, <br>
Clings to one leg: a souvenir, it seems: <br>
The garter, from twin diamonds, with the cold <br>
Stare of a viper gleams.<br>
</p>

<p>
The singular effect of solitude<br>
And of a languorous portrait, with its eyes<br>
Provocative as is its attitude,<br>
Dark loves would advertise &mdash; <br>
</p>

<p>
And guilty joys, with feasts of strange delight, <br>
Full of infernal kisses, omens certain <br>
To please the gloating angels of the Night <br>
Who swim behind each curtain.<br>
</p>

<p>
And yet to see her nimble strength, the risky<br>
Swerve of the rounded shoulder, and its rake,<br>
The tented haunch, the figure lithe and frisky,<br>
Flexed like an angry snake,<br>
</p>

<p>
You'd know that she was young. <br>
Her soul affronted, Her senses stung with boredom &mdash; were they bayed <br>
By packs of wandering, lost desires, and hunted, <br>
And finally betrayed?<br>
</p>

<p>
The vengeful man, whose lust you could not sate, <br>
(In spite of much love) nor quench his fire &mdash; <br>
Did he on your dead flesh then consummate <br>
His monstrous, last desire?<br>
</p>

<p>
Answer me, corpse impure! With fevered fist, <br>
Grim visage, did he raise you up on high, <br>
And, as your silver frosty teeth he kissed, <br>
Bid you his last goodbye?<br>
</p>

<p>
Far from inquiring magistrates that sneer, <br>
Far from this world of raillery and riot, <br>
Sleep peacefully, strange creature, on your bier, <br>
Of mystery and quiet.<br>
</p>

<p>
Your lover roams the world. Your deathless shape<br>
Watches his sleep and hears each indrawn breath. <br>
No more than you can he ever escape <br>
From constancy till death!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>

<p>
<b>Still Life</b><br>
</p>

<p>
From a Drawing by an Unknown master<br>
</p>

<p>
Flasks of perfume, fabrics lam&eacute; and spangled, rich<br>
Furnishings of brocade and gold,<br>
Statues of marble, paintings, scented dresses which<br>
Trail, fold on sumptuous soft fold,<br>
</p>

<p>
A warm room, sultry as a hothouse, where one fears<br>
The air is poisonous with death,<br>
Faded bouquets which, drooping in their crystal biers,<br>
Exhale their ultimate faint breath.<br>
</p>

<p>
A headless corpse pours forth a stream of vivid red<br>
Blood on damp pillows, and the white<br>
Linens absorb the bubbling flow into the bed<br>
Avidly as a meadow might.<br>
</p>

<p>
Pale as a specter born of a black dream's despair,<br>
To strike our eyes and rivet them,<br>
The head, with its dense curly mane of somber hair,<br>
And its detail of gold and gem,<br>
Rests on a small commode, like a ranunculus,<br>
Comfortably; void of surmise,<br>
A glint, leaden and blank as dawn, soars, vacuous,<br>
From the stone orbs of upturned eyes.<br>
</p>

<p>
The naked torso on the bed in graceful ease<br>
Exhibits without scruple or shame<br>
Her secret parts and all the fatal splendencies<br>
Nature bestowed upon this frame.<br>
On her leg, a pink stocking with gold clocks remains,<br>
As it were, like a souvenir,<br>
The jeweled garter, like a secret eye, retains <br>
A glance sharp as a diamond spear.<br>
</p>

<p>
That curious air of solitude and, with it, those<br>
Eyes gazing from a portrait near,<br>
As languid and provoking as the sitter's pose, <br>
Reveal what gloomy loves reigned here.<br>
Wraiths of strange feasts, of guilty joys, of recondite <br>
Demonic kisses passion moulds<br>
To fill the swarm of evil angels with delight, <br>
Still hover in the curtain's folds.<br>
</p>

<p>
She was still young! Did ennui gnaw her heart, exhaust <br>
Her senses, quench love's normal fires?<br>
Did she grant welcome to the thirsty pack of lost <br>
Pleasures and devious desires?<br>
</p>

<p>
That vengeful lover whom your wealth of love could still <br>
Not sate, you living and robust,<br>
Did he use your inert complacent flesh to fill <br>
The extreme limits of his lust?<br>
O corpse defiled, with fevered hand in his crazed drouth <br>
Did he grasp your stiff tresses? Tell,<br>
Tell me, grim head, did he glue on your icy mouth <br>
The kisses of his last farewell?<br>
</p>

<p>
Far from a jeering world and courts where without cease <br>
Magistrates probe as lawyers rave,<br>
O most bizarre of beings, sleep ever at peace, at peace <br>
In your remote mysterious grave.<br>
Whilst your mate roams the earth, your deathless form <br>
Keeps royal vigil over his sleeping breath,<br>
And surely, like yourself, he shall continue loyal <br>
And constant to you unto death.<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Murdered Woman</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Drawing of an Unknown Master<br>
</p>

<p>
Flasks of expensive scent, embroideries, rich brocades, <br>
Taffeta sofas, satin chairs;<br>
Statues in marble, paintings; fragrance that pervades <br>
The empty, sumptuous gowns; warm airs<br>
</p>

<p>
And sweet, &mdash; yet sultry, damp, unhealthful to inhale:<br>
That sickening green-house atmosphere<br>
Dying bouquets in their glass coffins give &mdash; a stale <br>
Voluptuous chamber... Lying here<br>
</p>

<p>
A corpse without a head, whence flows in a bright stream, <br>
Making an ever broadening stain,<br>
The red and living blood, which the white pillows seem <br>
To lap up like a thirsty plain.<br>
</p>

<p>
Pale as those awful shapes that out of shadow stare,<br>
Chaining our helpless eyes to theirs,<br>
The head, with its great mass of rich and somber hair &mdash; <br>
The earrings still in the small ears &mdash; <br>
</p>

<p>
Like a ranunculus on the night-table sits;<br>
And, void of thought, blank as the light<br>
Of dawn, a glinting vague regard escapes from its<br>
Eyeballs, up-rolled and china-white.<br>
</p>

<p>
The headless trunk, in shameless posture on the bed,<br>
Naked, in loose abandon lies,<br>
Its secret parts exposed, its treasures all outspread<br>
As if to charm a lover's eyes.<br>
</p>

<p>
One sequined stocking, pink against the milky thigh,<br>
Remains, pathetic souvenir;<br>
The jeweled garter, like a flashing, secret eye,<br>
Darts and withdraws a diamond leer.<br>
</p>

<p>
A languorous portrait on the wall contrives to give<br>
Force to the singular effect<br>
Of the deep solitude, &mdash; the eyes provocative,<br>
The pose inviting, half-erect.<br>
</p>

<p>
The ghost of something strange and guilty, of some feast<br>
Involving most improper fare,<br>
Demoniac kisses, all obscure desires released,<br>
Swims in the silent curtains there.<br>
</p>

<p>
And yet, that fragile shoulder, that fine hand and arm &mdash; <br>
How delicate the curve they make! &mdash; <br>
The pelvic bones so sweetly pointed, the whole form<br>
Lithe as a teased and fighting snake! &mdash; <br>
</p>

<p>
She must have been quite young... her senses, all her soul,<br>
Avid for life and driven wild<br>
By tedium, set ajar, it may be, to the whole<br>
Pack of perversions... ah, poor child!<br>
</p>

<p>
Did he at length, that man, his awful thirst too great<br>
For living flesh to satisfy,<br>
On this inert, obedient body consummate<br>
His lust? &mdash; O ravished corpse, reply!<br>
</p>

<p>
Answer me, impure thing! Speak, frightening head, and tell:<br>
Lifting you up by your long hair,<br>
Did he on your cold teeth imprint in last farewell<br>
One kiss, before he set you there?<br>
</p>

<p>
Far from the mocking world, the peering crowd, oh far<br>
From inquest, coroner, magistrate,<br>
Sleep; sleep in peace; I leave you lying as you are,<br>
Mysterious unfortunate.<br>
</p>

<p>
In vain your lover roves the world; the thought of you<br>
Troubles each chamber where he lies:<br>
Even as you are true to him, he will be true<br>
To you, no doubt, until he dies.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Edna St. Vincent Millay, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>

<p>
<b>A Martyred Woman</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Sketch by an Unknown Master<br>
</p>

<p>
In the middle of scent-bottles, braided material<br>
And voluptuous furniture,<br>
Amongst marbles, pictures, perfumed dresses <br>
Trailing in expensive folds,<br>
</p>

<p>
In a warm room, where like a hothouse<br>
The air is dangerous, fatal,<br>
Where dying flowers sigh out their last <br>
In their glass coffins,<br>
</p>

<p>
A headless corpse discharges, like a river, <br>
Upon the slaked pillow,<br>
Its red and living blood, which the linen laps up<br>
With the greed of a meadow.<br>
</p>

<p>
Like those ghastly visions engendered by shadows, <br>
And riveting our eyes<br>
The head, with the weight of its dark mane <br>
And its precious jewels<br>
</p>

<p>
Rests like a plant on the bedside table; <br>
And, empty of thoughts,<br>
A look, loose and white as twilight <br>
Escapes its misplaced eyes.<br>
</p>

<p>
On the bed the naked, shameless trunk spreads out <br>
In utter unconstraint<br>
Its secret splendor and its fatal beauty, <br>
The gift of nature;<br>
</p>

<p>
A pink stocking, embroidered with gold sequins, remains<br>
On the leg like a memory;<br>
The garter, like a flaming, hidden eye, <br>
Darts a diamonded glance.<br>
</p>

<p>
The strange look of this solitude<br>
And of a great languorous tableau,<br>
To eyes provocative as her posture<br>
Reveals a dark love,<br>
</p>

<p>
A guilty joy and strange feasts,<br>
Full of the kisses of hell<br>
That please the swarms of evil angels<br>
Swimming in the folds of curtains;<br>
</p>

<p>
And yet, seeing that elegant emaciation<br>
Of shoulder with the blatant contour<br>
The hip a little angular and the taut waistline<br>
Like a furious reptile,<br>
</p>

<p>
She is still quite young! &mdash; Did her inflamed soul<br>
And her senses gnawn by boredom<br>
Yawn for that thirsty pack of<br>
Wandering, lost passions?<br>
</p>

<p>
Did that vengeful man whom, living, you could not gratify,<br>
In spite of so much love<br>
Heap upon your indolent, accommodating flesh<br>
The size of his desire?<br>
</p>

<p>
Answer, O violated corpse! and raising yourself with feverish arm<br>
By your stiff braids,<br>
Tell me, terrifying head, did he press upon your cold teeth<br>
His final farewells?<br>
</p>

<p>
 &mdash; Far from the bantering world, from the corrupted mob,<br>
Far from inquisitive magistrates,<br>
Sleep peacefully, sleep peacefully, strange creature,<br>
In your mysterious tomb;<br>
</p>

<p>
Your husband roves the world and your deathless figure<br>
Watches by him when he sleeps;<br>
Doubtless he will be faithful as you are,<br>
And constant to death.<br>
</p>

<p>
