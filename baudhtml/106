<b>La Muse malade</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Ma pauvre muse, h&eacute;las! qu'as-tu donc ce matin?<br>
Tes yeux creux sont peupl&eacute;s de visions nocturnes,<br>
Et je vois tour &agrave; tour r&eacute;fl&eacute;chis sur ton teint<br>
La folie et l'horreur, froides et taciturnes.<br>
</p>

<p>
Le succube verd&acirc;tre et le rose lutin <br>
T'ont-ils vers&eacute; la peur et l'amour de leurs urnes?<br>
Le cauchemar, d'un poing despotique et mutin<br>
T'a-t-il noy&eacute;e au fond d'un fabuleux Minturnes?<br>
</p>

<p>
Je voudrais qu'exhalant l'odeur de la sant&eacute;<br>
Ton sein de pensers forts f&ucirc;t toujours fr&eacute;quent&eacute;,<br>
Et que ton sang chr&eacute;tien coul&acirc;t &agrave; flots rythmiques,<br>
</p>

<p>
Comme les sons nombreux des syllabes antiques,<br>
O&ugrave; r&egrave;gnent tour &agrave; tour le p&egrave;re des chansons,<br>
Phoebus, et le grand Pan, le seigneur des moissons.<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>The Sick Muse</b><br>
</p>

<p>
My poor Muse, alas! what ails you today? <br>
Your hollow eyes are full of nocturnal visions; <br>
I see in turn reflected on your face <br>
Horror and madness, cold and taciturn.<br>
</p>

<p>
Have the green succubus, the rosy elf,<br>
Poured out for you love and fear from their urns?<br>
Has the hand of Nightmare, cruel and despotic,<br>
Plunged you to the bottom of some weird Minturnae?<br>
</p>

<p>
I would that your bosom, fragrant with health,<br>
Were constantly the dwelling place of noble thoughts,<br>
And that your Christian blood would flow in rhythmic waves<br>
</p>

<p>
Like the measured sounds of ancient verse, <br>
Over which reign in turn the father of all songs, <br>
Phoebus, and the great Pan, lord of harvest.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Sick Muse</b>
</p>

<p>
Alas, poor Muse, what ails you so today? <br>
Your hollow eyes with midnight visions burn, <br>
And turn about, in your complexion play <br>
Madness and horror, cold and taciturn.<br>
</p>

<p>
Green succubus and rosy imp &mdash; have they <br>
Poured you both fear and love into one glass? <br>
Or with his tyrant fist the nightmare, say, <br>
Submerged you in some fabulous morass?<br>
</p>

<p>
I wish that, breathing health, your breast might nourish<br>
Ever robuster thoughts therein to flourish:<br>
And that your Christian blood, in rhythmic flow,<br>
</p>

<p>
With those old polysyllables would chime, <br>
Where, turn about, reigned Phoebus, sire of rhyme, <br>
And Pan, the lord of harvests long ago.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Sick Muse</b> <br>
</p>

<p>
What's the matter with you today, Muse?<br>
Are you going to tell me about last night's visions,<br>
Heads on spikes, natives dancing a frenzied juba,<br>
And all kinds of other stuff?<br>
</p>

<p>
Oh you pink-lipped succubus!<br>
You just don't want me to shoot into you.<br>
You say you drowned, at Actium or Lepanto.<br>
Again? What a nightmare.<br>
</p>

<p>
I only want you to heave health<br>
Be thinking of strongly urged Christian Things<br>
And you tied to a bed<br>
</p>

<p>
So, count it out and<br>
Moan your dirge &mdash;<br>
I'm climbing on.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Will Schmitz<br>

<p>
<b>The Sick Muse</b>
</p>

<p>
Alas &mdash; my poor Muse &mdash; what aileth thee now? <br>
Thine eyes are bedimmed with the visions of Night, <br>
And silent and cold &mdash; I perceive on thy brow <br>
In their turns &mdash; Despair and Madness alight. <br>
</p>

<p>
A succubus green, or a hobgoblin red, <br>
Has it poured o'er thee Horror and Love from its urn?<br>
Or the Nightmare with masterful bearing hath led <br>
Thee to drown in the depths of some magic Minturne? <br>
</p>

<p>
I wish, as the health-giving fragrance I cull, <br>
That thy breast with strong thoughts could for ever be full, <br>
And that rhymthmic'ly flowing &mdash; thy Christian blood <br>
</p>

<p>
Could resemble the olden-time metrical-flood, <br>
Where each in his turn reigned the father of Rhymes <br>
Phoebus &mdash; and Pan, lord of Harvest-times. <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Cyril Scott, <i>Baudelaire: The Flowers of Evil</i> (London: Elkin Mathews, 1909)
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>La Muse malade</b><br>
</p>

<p>
poor Muse, alas! what ails thee now? for thy<br>
great hollow eyes with sights nocturnal burn, <br>
and in thy changing pallor I descry<br>
madness and frozen horror, turn by turn.<br>
</p>

<p>
did rosy sprites or pale green succubi<br>
pour love or panic from their dream-filled urn?<br>
did the mad fist of despot nightmare try<br>
to drown thee where the fiends of hell sojourn?<br>
</p>

<p>
I would that thou wert always filled with health<br>
and manly thoughts undaunted; that a wealth<br>
of Christian blood were thine, which always flowed<br>
</p>

<p>
in calm broad rhythms like a Grecian ode,<br>
now echoing forth Apollo's golden strain,<br>
and now great Pan, the lord of ripening grain.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Lewis Piaget Shanks, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (New York: Ives Washburn, 1931)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Sick Muse</b>
</p>

<p>
Poor Muse, alas, what ail's thee, then, to-day?<br>
Thy hollow eyes with midnight visions burn,<br>
Upon thy brow in alternation play,<br>
Folly and Horror, cold and taciturn.<br>
</p>

<p>
Have the green lemure and the goblin red,<br>
Poured on thee love and terror from their urn?<br>
Or with despotic hand the nightmare dread<br>
Deep plunged thee in some fabulous Mintume?<br>
</p>

<p>
Would that thy breast where so deep thoughts arise,<br>
Breathed forth a healthful perfume with thy sighs;<br>
Would that thy Christian blood ran wave by wave<br>
</p>

<p>
In rhythmic sounds the antique numbers gave,<br>
When Ph≈ìbus shared his alternating reign<br>
With mighty Pan, lord of the ripening grain.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; F.P. Sturm, from <i>Baudelaire: His Prose and Poetry</i>, edited by Thomas Robert Smith (New York: Boni and Liveright, 1919)

Two editions of <i>Fleurs du mal</i> were published in Baudelaire's lifetime &mdash; one in 1857 and an expanded edition in 1861. "Scraps" and censored poems were collected in <i>Les &Eacute;paves</i> in 1866. After Baudelaire died the following year, a "definitive" edition appeared in 1868.
