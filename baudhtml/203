<b>La Chevelure</b><br>
</p>

<p>
&Ocirc; toison, moutonnant jusque sur l'encolure!<br>
&Ocirc; boucles! &Ocirc; parfum charg&eacute; de nonchaloir!<br>
Extase! Pour peupler ce soir l'alc&ocirc;ve obscure<br>
Des souvenirs dormant dans cette chevelure,<br>
Je la veux agiter dans l'air comme un mouchoir!<br>
</p>

<p>
La langoureuse Asie et la br&ucirc;lante Afrique,<br>
Tout un monde lointain, absent, presque d&eacute;funt,<br>
Vit dans tes profondeurs, for&ecirc;t aromatique!<br>
Comme d'autres esprits voguent sur la musique,<br>
Le mien, &ocirc; mon amour! nage sur ton parfum.<br>
</p>

<p>
J'irai l&agrave;-bas o&ugrave; l'arbre et l'homme, pleins de s&egrave;ve,<br>
Se p&acirc;ment longuement sous l'ardeur des climats;<br>
Fortes tresses, soyez la houle qui m'enl&egrave;ve!<br>
Tu contiens, mer d'&eacute;b&egrave;ne, un &eacute;blouissant r&ecirc;ve<br>
De voiles, de rameurs, de flammes et de m&acirc;ts:<br>
</p>

<p>
Un port retentissant o&ugrave; mon &acirc;me peut boire<br>
&Agrave; grands flots le parfum, le son et la couleur<br>
O&ugrave; les vaisseaux, glissant dans l'or et dans la moire<br>
Ouvrent leurs vastes bras pour embrasser la gloire<br>
D'un ciel pur o&ugrave; fr&eacute;mit l'&eacute;ternelle chaleur.<br>
</p>

<p>
Je plongerai ma t&ecirc;te amoureuse d'ivresse<br>
Dans ce noir oc&eacute;an o&ugrave; l'autre est enferm&eacute;;<br>
Et mon esprit subtil que le roulis caresse<br>
Saura vous retrouver, &ocirc; f&eacute;conde paresse,<br>
Infinis bercements du loisir embaum&eacute;!<br>
</p>

<p>
Cheveux bleus, pavillon de t&eacute;n&egrave;bres tendues<br>
Vous me rendez l'azur du ciel immense et rond;<br>
Sur les bords duvet&eacute;s de vos m&egrave;ches tordues<br>
Je m'enivre ardemment des senteurs confondues<br>
De l'huile de coco, du musc et du goudron.<br>
</p>

<p>
Longtemps! toujours! ma main dans ta crini&egrave;re lourde<br>
S&egrave;mera le rubis, la perle et le saphir,<br>
Afin qu'&agrave; mon d&eacute;sir tu ne sois jamais sourde!<br>
N'es-tu pas l'oasis o&ugrave; je r&ecirc;ve, et la gourde<br>
O&ugrave; je hume &agrave; longs traits le vin du souvenir?<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>Head of Hair</b><br>
</p>

<p>
O fleecy hair, falling in curls to the shoulders! <br>
O black locks! O perfume laden with nonchalance! <br>
Ecstasy! To people the dark alcove tonight <br>
With memories sleeping in that thick head of hair. <br>
I would like to shake it in the air like a scarf!<br>
</p>

<p>
Sweltering Africa and languorous Asia, <br>
A whole far-away world, absent, almost defunct, <br>
Dwells in your depths, aromatic forest! <br>
While other spirits glide on the wings of music, <br>
Mine, O my love! floats upon your perfume.<br>
</p>

<p>
I shall go there, where trees and men, full of vigor, <br>
Are plunged in a deep swoon by the heat of the land; <br>
Heady tresses be the billows that carry me away! <br>
Ebony sea, you hold a dazzling dream <br>
Of rigging, of rowers, of pennons and of masts:<br>
</p>

<p>
A clamorous harbor where my spirit can drink <br>
In great draughts the perfume, the sound and the color; <br>
Where the vessels gliding through the gold and the moire <br>
Open wide their vast arms to embrace the glory <br>
Of a clear sky shimmering with everlasting heat.<br>
</p>

<p>
I shall bury my head enamored with rapture<br>
In this black sea where the other is imprisoned;<br>
And my subtle spirit caressed by the rolling<br>
Will find you once again, O fruitful indolence,<br>
Endless lulling of sweet-scented leisure!<br>
</p>

<p>
Blue-black hair, pavilion hung with shadows, <br>
You give back to me the blue of the vast round sky; <br>
In the downy edges of your curling tresses <br>
I ardently get drunk with the mingled odors <br>
Of oil of coconut, of musk and tar.<br>
</p>

<p>
A long time! Forever! my hand in your thick mane <br>
Will scatter sapphires, rubies and pearls, <br>
So that you will never be deaf to my desire! <br>
Aren't you the oasis of which I dream, the gourd <br>
From which I drink deeply, the wine of memory?<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Her Hair</b>
</p>

<p>
O fleece that down her nape rolls, plume on plume! <br>
O curls! O scent of nonchalance and ease! <br>
What ecstasy! To populate this room <br>
With memories it harbours in its gloom, <br>
I'd shake it like a banner on the breeze.<br>
</p>

<p>
Hot Africa and languid Asia play <br>
(An absent world, defunct, and far away) <br>
Within that scented forest, dark and dim. <br>
As other souls on waves of music swim, <br>
Mine on its perfume sails, as on the spray.<br>
</p>

<p>
I'll journey there, where man and sap-filled tree <br>
Swoon in hot light for hours. Be you my sea, <br>
Strong tresses! Be the breakers and gales <br>
That waft me. Your black river holds, for me, <br>
A dream of masts and rowers, flames and sails.<br>
</p>

<p>
A port, resounding there, my soul delivers <br>
With long deep draughts of perfumes, scent, and clamour, <br>
Where ships, that glide through gold and purple rivers, <br>
Fling wide their vast arms to embrace the glamour <br>
Of skies wherein the heat forever quivers.<br>
</p>

<p>
I'll plunge my head in it, half drunk with pleasure &mdash; <br>
In this black ocean that engulfs her form. <br>
My soul, caressed with wavelets there may measure <br>
Infinite rocking in embalmed leisure, <br>
Creative idleness that fears no storm!<br>
</p>

<p>
Blue tresses, like a shadow-stretching tent, <br>
You shed the blue of heavens round and far. <br>
Along its downy fringes as I went <br>
I reeled half-drunken to confuse the scent <br>
Of oil of coconuts, with musk and tar.<br>
</p>

<p>
My hand forever in your mane so dense, <br>
Rubies and pearls and sapphires there will sow, <br>
That you to my desire be never slow &mdash; <br>
Oasis of my dreams, and gourd from whence <br>
Deep-draughted wines of memory will flow.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>


<p>
<b>The Fleece</b><br>
</p>

<p>
O shadowy fleece that falls and curls upon those bare<br>
Lithe shoulders! O rich perfume of forgetfulness!<br>
O ecstasy! To loose upon the midnight air<br>
The memories asleep in this tumultuous hair,<br>
I long to rake it in my fingers, tress by tress!<br>
</p>

<p>
Asia the languorous, the burning solitude <br>
Of Africa &mdash; a whole world, distant, all but dead &mdash; <br>
Survives in thy profundities, O odorous wood! <br>
My soul, as other souls put forth on the deep flood <br>
Of music, sails away upon thy scent instead.<br>
</p>

<p>
There where the sap of life mounts hot in man and tree, <br>
And lush desire untamed swoons in the torrid zone, <br>
Undulant tresses, wild strong waves, oh, carry me! <br>
Dream, like a dazzling sun, from out this ebony sea <br>
Rises; and sails and banks of rowers propel me on.<br>
</p>

<p>
All the confusion, all the mingled colors, cries, <br>
Smells of a busy port, upon my senses beat; <br>
Where smoothly on the golden streak&egrave;d ripples flies <br>
The barque, its arms outspread to gather in the skies, <br>
Against whose glory trembles the unabating heat.<br>
</p>

<p>
In this black ocean where the primal ocean roars,<br>
Drunken, in love with drunkenness, I plunge and drown;<br>
Over my dubious spirit the rolling tide outpours<br>
Its peace &mdash; oh, fruitful indolence, upon thy shores,<br>
Cradled in languor, let me drift and lay me down!<br>
</p>

<p>
Blue hair, darkness made palpable, like the big tent <br>
Of desert sky all glittering with many a star <br>
Thou coverest me &mdash; oh, I am drugged as with the blent <br>
Effluvia of a sleeping caravan, the scent <br>
Of coco oil impregnated with musk and tar.<br>
</p>

<p>
Fear not! Upon this savage mane for ever thy lord <br>
Will sow pearls, sapphires, rubies, every stone that gleams, <br>
To keep thee faithful! Art not thou the sycamored <br>
Oasis whither my thoughts journey, and the dark gourd <br>
Whereof I drink in long slow draughts the wine of dreams?<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; George Dillon &amp; Edna St. Vincent Millay, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>
</p>


<br>

<p>
<b>Of Her Hair</b><br>
</p>

<p>
O fleece, billowing on her neck! O ecstasy!<br>
O curls, O perfume rich with nonchalance, O rare!.<br>
Tonight to fill the alcove's warm obscurity,<br>
To make that hair evoke each dormant memory,<br>
I long to wave it like a kerchief in the air.<br>
</p>

<p>
Africa smoldering and Asia languorous,<br>
A whole far distant world, absent and almost spent,<br>
Dwells in your forest depths, mystic and odorous!<br>
As others lose themselves in the harmonious,<br>
So, love, my heart floats lost upon your haunting scent.<br>
</p>

<p>
I shall go where both man and tree, albeit strong,<br>
Swoon deep beneath the rays of sunlight's blazing fires.<br>
Thick tresses, be the waves to bear my dreams along!<br>
Ebony sea, your dazzling dream contains a throng<br>
Of sails, of wafts, of oarsmen, and of masts like spires.<br>
</p>

<p>
A noisy harbor where my thirsty soul may drain<br>
Hues, sounds and fragrances, in draughts heavy and sweet,<br>
Where vessels gliding down a moir&eacute;-and-gold sea lane<br>
Open their vast arms wide to clutch at the domain<br>
Of a pure sky ashimmer with eternal beat.<br>
</p>

<p>
Deep shall I plunge my head, avid of drunkenness,<br>
In this black sea wherein the other sea lies captured,<br>
And my soul buoyant at its undulant caress<br>
Shall find you once again, O fruitful idleness,<br>
O long lullings of ease, soft, honeyed and enraptured.<br>
</p>

<p>
O blue-black hair, pennon with sheen and shadow fraught,<br>
You give me back the vast blue skies of dawn and dusk,<br>
As on the downy edges of your tresses, caught<br>
In your soft curls, I grow drunken and hot, distraught<br>
By mingled scents of cocoanut and tar and musk.<br>
</p>

<p>
Sapphires, rubies, pearls &mdash; my hand shall never tire<br>
Of strewing these through your thick mane &mdash; how lavishly! &mdash; <br>
Lest Life should ever turn you deaf to my desire!<br>
You are the last oasis where I dream, afire,<br>
The gourd whence deep I quaff the wine of memory.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jacques LeClercq, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (Mt Vernon, NY: Peter Pauper Press, 1958)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>La Chevelure</b>
</p>

<p>
O fleece, that foams down unto the shoulders bare! <br>
O curls, O scents which lovely languidness exhale! <br>
Delight! to fill this alcove's sombre atmosphere <br>
With memories, sleeping deep within this tress of hair, <br>
I'll wave it in the evening breezes like a veil! <br>
</p>

<p>
The shores of Africa, and Asia's burning skies, <br>
A world forgotten, distant, nearly dead and spent, <br>
Within thy depths, O aromatic forest! lies. <br>
And like to spirits floating unto melodies, <br>
Mine own, Beloved! glides within thy sacred scent. <br>
</p>

<p>
There I will hasten, where the trees and humankind <br>
With languor lull beside the hot and silent sea;<br>
Strong tresses bear me, be to me the waves and wind!<br>
Within thy fragrance lies a dazzling dream confined <br>
Of sails and masts and flames &mdash; O lake of ebony! <br>
</p>

<p>
A loudly echoing harbour, where my soul may hold <br>
To quaff, the silver cup of colours, scents and sounds, <br>
Wherein the vessels glide upon a sea of gold, <br>
And stretch their mighty arms, the glory to enfold <br>
Of virgin skies, where never-ending heat abounds. <br>
</p>

<p>
I'll plunge my brow, enamoured with voluptuousness <br>
Within this darkling ocean of infinitude, <br>
Until my subtle spirit, which thy waves caress, <br>
Shall find you once again, O fertile weariness;<br>
Unending lullabye of perfumed lassitude! <br>
</p>

<p>
Ye tresses blue &mdash; recess of strange and sombre shades, <br>
Ye make the azure of the starry Realm immense;<br>
Upon the downy beeches, by your curls' cascades, <br>
Among your mingling fragrances, my spirit wades <br>
To cull the musk and cocoa-nut and lotus scents. <br>
</p>

<p>
Long &mdash; foraye &mdash; my hand, within thy heavy mane, <br>
Shall scatter rubies, pearls, sapphires eternally, <br>
And thus my soul's desire for thee shall never wane;<br>
For art not thou the oasis where I dream and drain <br>
With draughts profound, the golden wine of memory? <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Cyril Scott, <i>Baudelaire: The Flowers of Evil</i> (London: Elkin Mathews, 1909)
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>La Chevelure</b><br>
</p>

<p>
O billows flowing o'er the shoulders bare! <br>
O curls! O perfume sweet beyond belief! <br>
Here in this bower to people the night air <br>
With all the memories sleeping in this hair <br>
I long to shake it like a handkerchief! <br>
</p>

<p>
Fierce Afric and the languorous Orient, <br>
All a vast world, distant, nay, almost dead, <br>
Within this aromatic wood is pent; <br>
My soul beloved floats upon thy scent <br>
As other souls have music for a bed. <br>
</p>

<p>
I will go out where full-veined man and tree <br>
Swoon daylong in the sultry summer's heat &mdash;<br>
Strong tresses be the barque which carries me: <br>
Thou boldest a bright dream, O ebon sea. <br>
Of sails, flames, rowers, on a splendid fleet; <br>
</p>

<p>
A harbour where through every sense are rolled <br>
Vast sweeping waves of perfume, sound, and hue, <br>
Where vessels gliding over moire and gold <br>
Stretch up great arms to heaven to enfold <br>
The glory of the everlasting blue. <br>
</p>

<p>
There waits for me delicious drunkenness <br>
In this dark sea which holds those other seas; <br>
My spirit in the gentle main's caress <br>
Shall know once more the old rich idleness, <br>
Infinite rockings of embalmed ease. <br>
</p>

<p>
Ah! dark-blue, streaming banner of the night, <br>
You bring me back those azure skies afar, <br>
Plunged in your silken folds my soul takes flight <br>
And drinks once more with measureless delight <br>
The scent of cocoa-oil and musk and tar. <br>
</p>

<p>
For ever I will scatter in each strand, <br>
That thou may'st never turn deaf ears to me, <br>
Rubies, pearls, sapphires with a lavish hand. . . . <br>
Thou art the well-spring in a desert land <br>
Wherefrom I quaff deep draughts of memory. <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jack Collings Squire, <i>Poems and Baudelaire Flowers</i> (London: The New Age Press, Ltd, 1909)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Head of Hair</b><br>
</p>

<p>
O Fleece, foaming to the neck!<br>
O curls! O scent of laziness!<br>
Ecstasy! This evening, to people the dark corners<br>
Of memories that are sleeping in these locks,<br>
I would wave them in the air like a handkerchief!<br>
</p>

<p>
Languorous Asia and burning Africa, <br>
A whole world, distant, absent, almost extinct, <br>
Lives in the depths of your perfumed jungle; <br>
As other souls sail along on music, <br>
So mine, O my love, swims on your scent.<br>
</p>

<p>
I shall go over there where trees and men, full of sap, <br>
Faint away slowly in the passionate climate; <br>
O strong locks, be the sea-swell that transports me! <br>
You keep, O sea of ebony, a dazzling dream <br>
Of sails and sailormen, flames and masts:<br>
</p>

<p>
A resounding haven where in great waves<br>
My soul can drink the scent, the sound and color;<br>
Where ships, sliding in gold and watered silk,<br>
Part their vast arms to embrace the glory<br>
Of the pure sky shuddering with eternal heat<br>
</p>

<p>
I shall plunge my head, adoring drunkenness,<br>
Into this black ocean where the other is imprisoned;<br>
And my subtle spirit caressed by the sway<br>
Will know how to find you, O pregnant idleness!<br>
In an infinite cradle of scented leisure!<br>
</p>

<p>
Blue hair, house of taut darkness,<br>
You make the blue of the sky seem huge and round for me;<br>
On the downy edges of your twisted locks<br>
I hungrily get drunk on the muddled fragrances<br>
Of coconut oil, of musk and tar<br>
</p>

<p>
For a long time! For ever! Amongst your heavy mane <br>
My hand will strew the ruby, pearl and sapphire <br>
To make you never deaf to my desire!<br>
For are you not the oasis where I dream, the gourd <br>
Where in great draughts I gulp the wine of memory?<br>
</p>

<p>
