<b>Le Cygne</b><br>
</p>

<p>
<i>&Agrave; Victor Hugo</i><br>
</p>

<p>
I
</p>

<p>
Andromaque, je pense &agrave; vous! Ce petit fleuve,<br>
Pauvre et triste miroir o&ugrave; jadis resplendit<br>
L'immense majest&eacute; de vos douleurs de veuve,<br>
Ce Simo&iuml;s menteur qui par vos pleurs grandit,<br>
</p>

<p>
A f&eacute;cond&eacute; soudain ma m&eacute;moire fertile,<br>
Comme je traversais le nouveau Carrousel.<br>
Le vieux Paris n'est plus (la forme d'une ville<br>
Change plus vite, h&eacute;las! que le coeur d'un mortel);<br>
</p>

<p>
Je ne vois qu'en esprit tout ce camp de baraques,<br>
Ces tas de chapiteaux &eacute;bauch&eacute;s et de f&ucirc;ts,<br>
Les herbes, les gros blocs verdis par l'eau des flaques,<br>
Et, brillant aux carreaux, le bric-&agrave;-brac confus.<br>
</p>

<p>
L&agrave; s'&eacute;talait jadis une m&eacute;nagerie;<br>
L&agrave; je vis, un matin, &agrave; l'heure o&ugrave; sous les cieux<br>
Froids et clairs le Travail s'&eacute;veille, o&ugrave; la voirie<br>
Pousse un sombre ouragan dans l'air silencieux,<br>
</p>

<p>
Un cygne qui s'&eacute;tait &eacute;vad&eacute; de sa cage,<br>
Et, de ses pieds palm&eacute;s frottant le pav&eacute; sec,<br>
Sur le sol raboteux tra&icirc;nait son blanc plumage.<br>
Pr&egrave;s d'un ruisseau sans eau la b&ecirc;te ouvrant le bec<br>
</p>

<p>
Baignait nerveusement ses ailes dans la poudre,<br>
Et disait, le coeur plein de son beau lac natal:<br>
&laquo;Eau, quand donc pleuvras-tu? quand tonneras-tu, foudre?&raquo;<br>
Je vois ce malheureux, mythe &eacute;trange et fatal,<br>
</p>

<p>
Vers le ciel quelquefois, comme l'homme d'Ovide,<br>
Vers le ciel ironique et cruellement bleu,<br>
Sur son cou convulsif tendant sa t&ecirc;te avide<br>
Comme s'il adressait des reproches &agrave; Dieu!<br>
</p>

<p>
II
</p>

<p>
Paris change! mais rien dans ma m&eacute;lancolie<br>
N'a boug&eacute;! palais neufs, &eacute;chafaudages, blocs,<br>
Vieux faubourgs, tout pour moi devient all&eacute;gorie<br>
Et mes chers souvenirs sont plus lourds que des rocs.<br>
</p>

<p>
Aussi devant ce Louvre une image m'opprime:<br>
Je pense &agrave; mon grand cygne, avec ses gestes fous,<br>
Comme les exil&eacute;s, ridicule et sublime<br>
Et rong&eacute; d'un d&eacute;sir sans tr&ecirc;ve! et puis &agrave; vous,<br>
</p>

<p>
Andromaque, des bras d'un grand &eacute;poux tomb&eacute;e,<br>
Vil b&eacute;tail, sous la main du superbe Pyrrhus,<br>
Aupr&egrave;s d'un tombeau vide en extase courb&eacute;e<br>
Veuve d'Hector, h&eacute;las! et femme d'H&eacute;l&eacute;nus!<br>
</p>

<p>
Je pense &agrave; la n&eacute;gresse, amaigrie et phtisique<br>
Pi&eacute;tinant dans la boue, et cherchant, l'oeil hagard,<br>
Les cocotiers absents de la superbe Afrique<br>
Derri&egrave;re la muraille immense du brouillard;<br>
</p>

<p>
&Agrave; quiconque a perdu ce qui ne se retrouve<br>
Jamais, jamais! &agrave; ceux qui s'abreuvent de pleurs<br>
Et t&egrave;tent la Douleur comme une bonne louve!<br>
Aux maigres orphelins s&eacute;chant comme des fleurs!<br>
</p>

<p>
Ainsi dans la for&ecirc;t o&ugrave; mon esprit s'exile<br>
Un vieux Souvenir sonne &agrave; plein souffle du cor! <br>
Je pense aux matelots oubli&eacute;s dans une &icirc;le,<br>
Aux captifs, aux vaincus!... &agrave; bien d'autres encor!<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>The Swan</b><br>
</p>

<p>
To Victor Hugo<br>
</p>

<p>
I<br>
</p>

<p>
Andromache, I think of you! &mdash; That little stream,<br>
That mirror, poor and sad, which glittered long ago<br>
With the vast majesty of your widow's grieving,<br>
That false Simois swollen by your tears,<br>
</p>

<p>
Suddenly made fruitful my teeming memory, <br>
As I walked across the new Carrousel.<br>
&mdash; Old Paris is no more (the form of a city <br>
Changes more quickly, alas! than the human heart);<br>
</p>

<p>
I see only in memory that camp of stalls, <br>
Those piles of shafts, of rough hewn cornices, the grass, <br>
The huge stone blocks stained green in puddles of water, <br>
And in the windows shine the jumbled bric-a-brac.<br>
</p>

<p>
Once a menagerie was set up there;<br>
There, one morning, at the hour when Labor awakens,<br>
Beneath the clear, cold sky when the dismal hubbub<br>
Of street-cleaners and scavengers breaks the silence,<br>
</p>

<p>
I saw a swan that had escaped from his cage,<br>
That stroked the dry pavement with his webbed feet<br>
And dragged his white plumage over the uneven ground.<br>
Beside a dry gutter the bird opened his beak,<br>
</p>

<p>
Restlessly bathed his wings in the dust<br>
And cried, homesick for his fair native lake:<br>
"Rain, when will you fall? Thunder, when will you roll?"<br>
I see that hapless bird, that strange and fatal myth,<br>
</p>

<p>
Toward the sky at times, like the man in Ovid, <br>
Toward the ironic, cruelly blue sky, <br>
Stretch his avid head upon his quivering neck, <br>
As if he were reproaching God!<br>
</p>

<p>
II<br>
</p>

<p>
Paris changes! but naught in my melancholy <br>
Has stirred! New palaces, scaffolding, blocks of stone, <br>
Old quarters, all become for me an allegory, <br>
And my dear memories are heavier than rocks.<br>
</p>

<p>
So, before the Louvre, an image oppresses me:<br>
I think of my great swan with his crazy motions,<br>
Ridiculous, sublime, like a man in exile,<br>
Relentlessly gnawed by longing! and then of you,<br>
</p>

<p>
Andromache, base chattel, fallen from the embrace<br>
Of a mighty husband into the hands of proud Pyrrhus,<br>
Standing bowed in rapture before an empty tomb,<br>
Widow of Hector, alas! and wife of Helenus!<br>
</p>

<p>
I think of the negress, wasted and consumptive, <br>
Trudging through muddy streets, seeking with a fixed gaze <br>
The absent coco-palms of splendid Africa <br>
Behind the immense wall of mist;<br>
</p>

<p>
Of whoever has lost that which is never found <br>
Again! Never! Of those who deeply drink of tears <br>
And suckle Pain as they would suck the good she-wolf!<br>
Of the puny orphans withering like flowers!<br>
</p>

<p>
Thus in the dim forest to which my soul withdraws,<br>
An ancient memory sounds loud the hunting horn!<br>
I think of the sailors forgotten on some isle,<br>
&mdash; Of the captives, of the vanquished!...of many others too!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Swan</b>
</p>

<p>
To Victor Hugo<br>
</p>

<p>
Andromache! &mdash; This shallow stream, the brief<br>
Mirror you once so grandly overcharged<br>
With your vast majesty of widowed grief,<br>
This lying Simois your tears enlarged,<br>
</p>

<p>
Evoked your name, and made me think of you, <br>
As I was crossing the new Carrousel.<br>
&mdash; Old Paris is no more (cities renew, <br>
Quicker than human hearts, their changing spell).<br>
</p>

<p>
In mind I see that camp of huts, the muddle <br>
Of rough-hewn roofs and leaning shafts for miles, <br>
The grass, green logs stagnating in the puddle, <br>
Where bric-a-brac lay glittering in piles.<br>
</p>

<p>
Once a menagerie parked there. <br>
And there it chanced one morning, when from slumber freed, <br>
Labour stands up, and Transport through still air <br>
Rumbles its sombre hurricane of speed, &mdash; <br>
</p>

<p>
A swan escaped its cage: and as its feet <br>
With finny palms on the harsh pavement scraped, <br>
Trailing white plumage on the stony street, <br>
In the dry gutter for fresh water gaped.<br>
</p>

<p>
Nervously bathing in the dust, in wonder <br>
It asked, remembering its native stream, <br>
"When will the rain come down? When roll the thunder?" <br>
I see it now, strange myth and fatal theme!<br>
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, like Ovid's wretch, towards the sky <br>
(Ironically blue with cruel smile) <br>
Its neck, convulsive, reared its head on high <br>
As though it were its Maker to revile.<br>
</p>

<p>
II<br>
</p>

<p>
Paris has changed, but in my grief no change. <br>
New palaces and scaffoldings and blocks, <br>
To me, are allegories, nothing strange. <br>
My memories are heavier than rocks.<br>
</p>

<p>
Passing the Louvre, one image makes me sad:<br>
That swan, like other exiles that we knew,<br>
Grandly absurd, with gestures of the mad,<br>
Gnawed by one craving! &mdash; Then I think of you,<br>
</p>

<p>
Who fell from your great husband's arms, to be <br>
A beast of freight for Pyrrhus, and for life, <br>
Bowed by an empty tomb in ecstasy &mdash; <br>
Great Hector's widow! Helenus's wife!<br>
</p>

<p>
I think, too, of the starved and phthisic negress <br>
Tramping the mud, who seeks, with haggard eye, <br>
The palms of Africa, and for some egress <br>
Out of this great black wall of foggy sky:<br>
</p>

<p>
Of those who've lost what they cannot recover: <br>
Of those who slake with tears their lonely hours <br>
And milk the she-wolf, Sorrow, for their mother: <br>
And skinny orphans withering like flowers.<br>
</p>

<p>
So in the forest of my soul's exile, <br>
Remembrance winds his horn as on he rides. <br>
I think of sailors stranded on an isle, <br>
Captives, and slaves &mdash; and many more besides.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Swan</b> <br>
</p>

<p>
Andromache, I think of you as I look down on the broad languid surface <br>
of the Seine from Carrousel Bridge.  It's a mirror of yesterday that undercuts<br>
my every feeling, even in this clear contemplation of you, still in your widow's<br>
grief, as cocky Phyrrus drags you to his bed.<br>
</p>

<p>
The Paris of old has undergone changes my heart cannot.  Now only in memory,<br>
the Paris of makeshift booths and crowded tradesmen's squares.  Every massive<br>
stone was covered with a green algaeous stain thrown up by wheels hurrying<br>
to keep the machinery of a divine indifference turning.  The once necessary<br>
storefront jumble of bric-a-brac has been effaced.<br>
</p>

<p>
A menagerie used to set up to the west of me.  Just over there, one morning,<br>
as the loud road menders came to work to hoist bricks in the bird-alive dawn, <br>
I saw a swan pecking at the peg holding shut its wicker cage.  Once free,<br>
it made for what it took for a wet gutter.  It had not rained in two weeks.<br>
Webbed feet dragged white plumes across a scorched street.  At the dried-<br>
up pool, the thirsty creature became frantic.  Flapping its wings, it shaded<br>
itself in a mist of acrid dust.  The neck twisted and the beak scraped the<br>
dirt.  Lifting its head to the cloudless sky, it scraked for water.  I can<br>
still hear that unhappy bird scolding the dreaming azure.  The amused<br>
owner tied a rope around the swan's neck and used a broom handle to<br>
prod it back into its cage.<br>
</p>

<p>
As Paris changes, my melancholy deepens.  The new palaces, covered by<br>
scaffolding and surrounded by blocks of stone, overlook the old suburbs<br>
that are being torn down to pave wide, utilitarian avenues.  The new city's<br>
coils strangle memory.  As I stand gazing at the everyday activity surrounding<br>
the Louvre, I have an oppressive vision -- my frenzied swan's desperation is<br>
the condition of the multiplying exiles on this globe.<br>
</p>

<p>
I think of you again, Andromache, as I watch a tubercular Negress trudging the<br>
steps of our courthouse counting on a pity it cannot offer.  Walking home by<br>
the street orphans living off the offal of third-class restaurants, I fix on<br>
Pacific cannibals, my friends' ennui, our insignificant bents, and on those<br>
daily made reviled, slaughtered Hector, Andromache in Phyrrus' bed.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Will Schmitz<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Le Cygne</b><br>
</p>

<p>
I
</p>

<p>
Andromache, of thee I think! and of<br>
the dreary streamlet where, through exiled years,<br>
shone the vast grandeur of thy widow's love,<br>
that false Simois brimmed with royal tears<br>
</p>

<p>
poured like the Nile across my memory strange,<br>
as past the Louvre new I strolled, apart.<br>
&mdash; Old Paris is no more (for cities change<br>
&mdash; alas! &mdash; more quickly than a mortal's heart);<br>
</p>

<p>
only my memory sees the capitals,<br>
the shafts unfinished once, in pools of rain,<br>
the slimy marble blocks, weeds, market-stalls<br>
with old brass gleaming through each dusty pane.<br>
</p>

<p>
that corner houses a whole menagerie once;<br>
and here one day I saw, when 'neath the fair<br>
cold heavens, Toil awoke, and over the stones<br>
the storm of traffic rent the silent air,<br>
</p>

<p>
a swan which from its cage had made escape<br>
patting the torrid blocks with webby feet,<br>
trailing great plumes of snow, while beak agape<br>
fumbled for water in the parching street;<br>
</p>

<p>
wildly it plunged its wings in dust again,<br>
mourning its native lake, and seemed to shrill:<br>
"lightning, when comest thou? and when, the rain?"<br>
strange symbol! wretched bird, I see it still,<br>
</p>

<p>
up to the sky, like Ovid's fool accurst,<br>
up to the cruelly blue ironic sky<br>
raising its neck convulsed and beak athirst,<br>
as though reproaching God in each mad cry.<br>
</p>

<p>
II
</p>

<p>
towns change... but in my melancholy naught<br>
has moved at all! new portals, ladders, blocks,<br>
old alleys &mdash; all become symbolic thought,<br>
in me, loved memories turn to moveless rocks.<br>
</p>

<p>
so, crushing me, the Louvre gates recall<br>
my huge white swan, insane with agony,<br>
comic, sublime, like exiles one and all<br>
by truceless cravings torn! I think of thee<br>
</p>

<p>
Andromache, a slave apportioned, whom<br>
proud Pyrrhus took from hands more glorious,<br>
in ecstasy bent o'er an empty tomb;<br>
great Hector's widow, wed to Helenus!<br>
</p>

<p>
I think of thee, consumptive Nubian,<br>
wading the mire, wan-eyed girl, agog<br>
to find the absent palms of proud Soudan<br>
behind the boundless rampart of the fog;<br>
</p>

<p>
I think of all who lose the boons we find<br>
no more! no more! who feed on tears and cling<br>
to the good she-wolf Grief, whose tears are kind!<br>
&mdash; of orphans gaunt like flowers withering!<br>
</p>

<p>
thus, in the jungle of my soul's exile,<br>
old memories wind a horn I've heard before!<br>
I think of sailors wrecked on some lost isle,<br>
of prisoners, captives!... and many more!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Lewis Piaget Shanks, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (New York: Ives Washburn, 1931)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Swan</b>
</p>

<p>
I<br>
</p>

<p>
Andromache, I think of you! The stream,<br>
The poor, sad mirror where in bygone days<br>
Shone all the majesty of your widowed grief,<br>
The lying Simoïs flooded by your tears,<br>
Made all my fertile memory blossom forth<br>
As I passed by the new-built Carrousel.<br>
Old Paris is no more (a town, alas,<br>
Changes more quickly than man's heart may change);<br>
Yet in my mind I still can see the booths;<br>
The heaps of brick and rough-hewn capitals;<br>
The grass; the stones all over-green with moss;<br>
The _débris_, and the square-set heaps of tiles.<br>
</p>

<p>
There a menagerie was once outspread;<br>
And there I saw, one morning at the hour<br>
When toil awakes beneath the cold, clear sky,<br>
And the road roars upon the silent air,<br>
A swan who had escaped his cage, and walked<br>
On the dry pavement with his webby feet,<br>
And trailed his spotless plumage on the ground.<br>
And near a waterless stream the piteous swan<br>
Opened his beak, and bathing in the dust<br>
His nervous wings, he cried (his heart the while<br>
Filled with a vision of his own fair lake):<br>
"O water, when then wilt thou come in rain?<br>
Lightning, when wilt thou glitter?"<br>
Sometimes yet<br>
I see the hapless bird &mdash; strange, fatal myth &mdash; <br>
Like him that Ovid writes of, lifting up<br>
Unto the cruelly blue, ironic heavens,<br>
With stretched, convulsive neck a thirsty face,<br>
As though he sent reproaches up to God!<br>
</p>

<p>
II<br>
</p>

<p>
Paris may change; my melancholy is fixed.<br>
New palaces, and scaffoldings, and blocks,<br>
And suburbs old, are symbols all to me<br>
Whose memories are as heavy as a stone.<br>
And so, before the Louvre, to vex my soul,<br>
The image came of my majestic swan<br>
With his mad gestures, foolish and sublime,<br>
As of an exile whom one great desire<br>
Gnaws with no truce. And then I thought of you,<br>
Andromache! torn from your hero's arms;<br>
Beneath the hand of Pyrrhus in his pride;<br>
Bent o'er an empty tomb in ecstasy;<br>
Widow of Hector &mdash; wife of Helenus!<br>
And of the negress, wan and phthisical,<br>
Tramping the mud, and with her haggard eyes<br>
Seeking beyond the mighty walls of fog<br>
The absent palm-trees of proud Africa;<br>
Of all who lose that which they never find;<br>
Of all who drink of tears; all whom grey grief<br>
Gives suck to as the kindly wolf gave suck;<br>
Of meagre orphans who like blossoms fade.<br>
And one old Memory like a crying horn<br>
Sounds through the forest where my soul is lost....<br>
I think of sailors on some isle forgotten;<br>
Of captives; vanquished ... and of many more.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; F.P. Sturm, from <i>Baudelaire: His Prose and Poetry</i>, edited by Thomas Robert Smith (New York: Boni and Liveright, 1919)
