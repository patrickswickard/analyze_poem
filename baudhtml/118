<b>La G&eacute;ante</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Du temps que la Nature en sa verve puissante<br>
Concevait chaque jour des enfants monstrueux,<br>
J'eusse aim&eacute; vivre aupr&egrave;s d'une jeune g&eacute;ante,<br>
Comme aux pieds d'une reine un chat voluptueux.<br>
</p>

<p>
J'eusse aim&eacute; voir son corps fleurir avec son &acirc;me<br>
Et grandir librement dans ses terribles jeux;<br>
Deviner si son coeur couve une sombre flamme<br>
Aux humides brouillards qui nagent dans ses yeux;<br>
</p>

<p>
Parcourir &agrave; loisir ses magnifiques formes;<br>
Ramper sur le versant de ses genoux &eacute;normes,<br>
Et parfois en &eacute;t&eacute;, quand les soleils malsains,<br>
</p>

<p>
Lasse, la font s'&eacute;tendre &agrave; travers la campagne,<br>
Dormir nonchalamment &agrave; l'ombre de ses seins,<br>
Comme un hameau paisible au pied d'une montagne.<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>The Giantess</b><br>
</p>

<p>
At the time when Nature with a lusty spirit <br>
Was conceiving monstrous children each day, <br>
I should have liked to live near a young giantess, <br>
Like a voluptuous cat at the feet of a queen.<br>
</p>

<p>
I should have liked to see her soul and body thrive <br>
And grow without restraint in her terrible games; <br>
To divine by the mist swimming within her eyes <br>
If her heart harbored a smoldering flame;<br>
</p>

<p>
To explore leisurely her magnificent form;<br>
To crawl upon the slopes of her enormous knees,<br>
And sometimes in summer, when the unhealthy sun<br>
</p>

<p>
Makes her stretch out, weary, across the countryside, <br>
To sleep nonchalantly in the shade of her breasts, <br>
Like a peaceful hamlet below a mountainside.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Giantess</b>
</p>

<p>
Of old when Nature, in her verve defiant, <br>
Conceived each day some birth of monstrous mien,<br>
I would have lived near some young female giant <br>
Like a voluptuous cat beside a queen;<br>
</p>

<p>
To see her body flowering with her soul <br>
Freely develop in her mighty games, <br>
And in the mists that through her gaze would roll <br>
Guess that her heart was hatching sombre flames;<br>
</p>

<p>
To roam her mighty contours as I please, <br>
Ramp on the cliff of her tremendous knees, <br>
And in the solstice, when the suns that kill<br>
</p>

<p>
Make her stretch out across the land and rest, <br>
To sleep beneath the shadow of her breast <br>
Like a hushed village underneath a hill.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<p>
<b>The Giantess</b><br>
</p>

<p>
In times of old when Nature in her glad excess <br>
Brought forth such living marvels as no more are seen, <br>
I should have loved to dwell with a young giantess, <br>
Like a voluptuous cat about the feet of a queen;<br>
</p>

<p>
To run and laugh beside her in her terrible games, <br>
And see her grow each day to a more fearful size, <br>
And see the flowering of her soul, and the first flames <br>
Of passionate longing in the misty depths of her eyes;<br>
</p>

<p>
To scale the slopes of her huge knees, explore at will<br>
The hollows and the heights of her &mdash; and when, oppressed<br>
By the long afternoons of summer, cloudless and still,<br>
</p>

<p>
She would stretch out across the countryside to rest, <br>
I should have loved to sleep in the shadow of her breast, <br>
Quietly as a village nestling under a hill.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; George Dillon, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Giantess</b><br>
</p>

<p>
In times when Nature, lusty to excess, <br>
Bred monstrous children, would that I had been <br>
Living beside a youthful giantess, <br>
Like a voluptuous cat beside a queen; <br>
To see her soul and body gain full size <br>
Blossoming freely in her fearsome games, <br>
And by the damp mists swimming in her eyes <br>
To watch her heart nursing what somber flames!<br>
</p>

<p>
To roam her mighty form at my sweet ease,<br>
To crawl along the slopes of her vast knees,<br>
And, summers, when the sun's unhealthy heats<br>
Made her sprawl, tired, across the countryside<br>
To sleep at leisure, shaded by her teats,<br>
Like a calm hamlet by the mountainside.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jacques LeClercq, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (Mt Vernon, NY: Peter Pauper Press, 1958)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Giantess</b>
</p>

<p>
I should have loved &mdash; erewhile when Heaven conceived <br>
Each day, some child abnormal and obscene, <br>
Beside a maiden giantess to have lived, <br>
Like a luxurious cat at the feet of a queen;<br>
</p>

<p>
To see her body flowering with her soul, <br>
And grow, unchained, in awe-inspiring art, <br>
Within the mists across her eyes that stole <br>
To divine the fires entombed within her heart. <br>
</p>

<p>
And oft to scramble o'er her mighty limbs, <br>
And climb the slopes of her enormous knees, <br>
Or in summer when the scorching sunlight streams <br>
</p>

<p>
Across the country, to recline at ease, <br>
And slumber in the shadow of her breast <br>
Like an hamlet 'neath the mountain-crest. <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Cyril Scott, <i>Baudelaire: The Flowers of Evil</i> (London: Elkin Mathews, 1909)
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Giantess</b><br>
</p>

<p>
When Nature once in lustful hot undress<br>
Conceived gargantuan offspring, then would I<br>
Have loved to live near a young giantess,<br>
Like a voluptuous cat at a queen's feet.<br>
</p>

<p>
To see her body flower with her desire<br>
And freely spread out in its dreadful play,<br>
Guess if her heart concealed some heavy fire<br>
Whose humid smokes would swim upon her eye.<br>
</p>

<p>
To feel at leisure her stupendous shapes,<br>
Crawl on the cliffs of her enormous knees,<br>
And, when in summer the unhealthy suns<br>
</p>

<p>
Have stretched her out across the plains, fatigued, <br>
Sleep in the shadows of her breasts at ease<br>
Like a small hamlet at a mountain's base.<br>
</p>


<p>
&mdash; Karl Shapiro, <i>Person, Place and Thing</i> (NY: Random House, 1942)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Giantess</b><br>
</p>

<p>
When Nature in her lavish lustiness <br>
Bred day by day new, strange monstrosities, <br>
Would I had lived with a young giantess <br>
Like a warm cat who at a queen's feet lies. <br>
</p>

<p>
'Twere sweet to watch her soul and body blossom <br>
While she disported her in terrible wise; <br>
To guess if a fierce flame burnt in her bosom <br>
By the wet mists that swam within her eyes. <br>
</p>

<p>
Ah! freely o'er her mighty limbs to run, <br>
To crawl upon the bend of her vast knees, <br>
And when in summer, tired of the pestilent sun, <br>
</p>

<p>
Across the plain she stretches calm and still, <br>
Within her breasts' cool shade to sleep at ease <br>
Like some small hamlet sheltered by a hill. <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jack Collings Squire, <i>Poems and Baudelaire Flowers</i> (London: The New Age Press, Ltd, 1909)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>La G&eacute;ante</b><br>
</p>

<p>
From the time when Nature in her furious fancy<br>
Conceived each day monstrosities obscene,<br>
I had loved to live near a young Giantess of Necromancy,<br>
Like a voluptuous cat before the knees of a Queen.<br>
</p>
 
<p>
I had loved to see her body mix with her Soul's shame<br>
And greaten in these terrible games of Vice,<br>
And to divine if in her heart brooded a somber flame,<br>
Before the moist sea-mists which swarm in her great eyes;<br>
</p>
 
<p>
To wander over her huge forms &#151; nature deforms us &#151;<br>
And to crawl over the slopes of her knees enormous,<br>
And in summer when the unwholesome suns from the West's<br>
</p>
 
<p>
Winds, weary, made her slumber hard by a fountain,<br>
To sleep listlessly in the shadow of her superb breasts,<br>
Like an hamlet that slumbers at the foot of a mountain.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Arthur Symons, <i>Baudelaire: Prose and Poetry</i> (NY: Albert and Charles Boni, 1926)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Giantess</b>
</p>

<p>
In those days when Nature's overwhelming Lust<br>
Engendered infant-monsters day by day<br>
I'd love to have lived with a young giantess.<br>
Like a lazy cat at the foot of my queen I'd lay.
</p>

<p>
I'd watch her grow into her gruesome games,<br>
As I observed her body blossom with her soul.<br>
And in the misty pools of her great eyes I'd try<br>
To spy some secret flame, ominous and cold.
</p>

<p>
Her magnificent forms, I'd cuddle lazily,<br>
Climbing the slopes of her gigantic knees. <br>
And when she tired of the sick mid-summer suns<br>
And stretched across the land to take her rest,<br>
Like a peaceful hamlet at the foot of the hills,<br>
I'd sleep serenely there in the shadow of her breast.
</p>

<p>
&mdash; James W. Underhill

<b>The Giantess</b><br>
</p>

<p>
In those times when Nature in powerful zest <br>
Conceived each day monstrous children, <br>
I would have loved to live near a young giantess, <br>
A voluptuous cat at the feet of a queen.<br>
</p>

<p>
I would have loved to see her body flower with her soul, <br>
To grow up freely in her prodigious play; <br>
To find if her heart bred some dark flame <br>
Amongst the humid mists swimming in her eyes;<br>
</p>

<p>
To run leisurely over her marvelous lines;<br>
To creep along the slopes of her enormous knees,<br>
And sometimes in summer, when impure suns<br>
</p>

<p>
Made her wearily stretch out across the countryside, <br>
To sleep carelessly in the shadow of her breasts, <br>
Like a peaceful village at the foot of a mountain.<br>
</p>

<p>
