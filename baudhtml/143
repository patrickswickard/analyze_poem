<b>Le Flacon</b><br>
</p>

<p>
II est de forts parfums pour qui toute mati&egrave;re<br>
Est poreuse. On dirait qu'ils p&eacute;n&egrave;trent le verre.<br>
En ouvrant un coffret venu de l'Orient<br>
Dont la serrure grince et rechigne en criant,<br>
</p>

<p>
Ou dans une maison d&eacute;serte quelque armoire<br>
Pleine de l'&acirc;cre odeur des temps, poudreuse et noire,<br>
Parfois on trouve un vieux flacon qui se souvient,<br>
D'o&ugrave; jaillit toute vive une &acirc;me qui revient.<br>
</p>

<p>
Mille pensers dormaient, chrysalides fun&egrave;bres,<br>
Fr&eacute;missant doucement dans les lourdes t&eacute;n&egrave;bres,<br>
Qui d&eacute;gagent leur aile et prennent leur essor,<br>
Teint&eacute;s d'azur, glac&eacute;s de rose, lam&eacute;s d'or.<br>
</p>

<p>
Voil&agrave; le souvenir enivrant qui voltige<br>
Dans l'air troubl&eacute;; les yeux se ferment; le Vertige<br>
Saisit l'&acirc;me vaincue et la pousse &agrave; deux mains<br>
Vers un gouffre obscurci de miasmes humains;<br>
</p>

<p>
II la terrasse au bord d'un gouffre s&eacute;culaire,<br>
O&ugrave;, Lazare odorant d&eacute;chirant son suaire,<br>
Se meut dans son r&eacute;veil le cadavre spectral<br>
D'un vieil amour ranci, charmant et s&eacute;pulcral.<br>
</p>

<p>
Ainsi, quand je serai perdu dans la m&eacute;moire<br>
Des hommes, dans le coin d'une sinistre armoire<br>
Quand on m'aura jet&eacute;, vieux flacon d&eacute;sol&eacute;,<br>
D&eacute;cr&eacute;pit, poudreux, sale, abject, visqueux, f&ecirc;l&eacute;,<br>
</p>

<p>
Je serai ton cercueil, aimable pestilence!<br>
Le t&eacute;moin de ta force et de ta virulence,<br>
Cher poison pr&eacute;par&eacute; par les anges! liqueur<br>
Qui me ronge, &ocirc; la vie et la mort de mon coeur!<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>The Perfume Flask</b><br>
</p>

<p>
There are strong perfumes for which all matter<br>
Is porous. One would say they go through glass.<br>
On opening a coffer that has come from the East,<br>
Whose creaking lock resists and grates,<br>
</p>

<p>
Or in a deserted house, some cabinet <br>
Full of the Past's acrid odor, dusty and black, <br>
Sometimes one finds an antique phial which remembers, <br>
Whence gushes forth a living soul returned to life.<br>
</p>

<p>
Many thoughts were sleeping, death-like chrysalides, <br>
Quivering softly in the heavy shadows, <br>
That free their wings and rise in flight, <br>
Tinged with azure, glazed with rose, spangled with gold.<br>
</p>

<p>
That is the bewitching souvenir which flutters <br>
In the troubled air; the eyes close; Dizziness <br>
Seizes the vanquished soul, pushes it with both hands <br>
Toward a darkened abyss of human pollution:<br>
</p>

<p>
He throws it down at the edge of an ancient abyss, <br>
Where, like stinking Lazarus tearing wide his shroud, <br>
There moves as it wakes up, the ghostly cadaver <br>
Of a rancid old love, charming and sepulchral.<br>
</p>

<p>
Thus, when I'll be lost to the memory<br>
Of men, when I shall be tossed into the corner<br>
Of a dismal wardrobe, a desolate old phial,<br>
Decrepit, cracked, slimy, dirty, dusty, abject,<br>
</p>

<p>
Delightful pestilence! I shall be your coffin,<br>
The witness of your strength and of your virulence,<br>
Beloved poison prepared by the angels! Liqueur<br>
That consumes me, O the life and death of my heart!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Flask</b>
</p>

<p>
Perfumes there are which through all things can pass<br>
And make all matter porous, even glass;<br>
Old coffers from the Orient brought, whose locks<br>
Grind sullenly when opening the box,<br>
</p>

<p>
Or, in an empty house, some ancient chest, <br>
Where time and dust and gloom were long compressed, <br>
May yield a flask where memory survives, <br>
And a soul flashes into future lives.<br>
</p>

<p>
A thousand thoughts, funereal larvae, laid <br>
Shuddering softly under palls of shade, <br>
May suddenly their soaring wings unfold, <br>
Stained azure, glazed with rose, or filmed with gold.<br>
</p>

<p>
Intoxicating memory now flies <br>
Into the dusk, and makes us close our eyes: <br>
Vertigo draws the spirit which it grips <br>
Towards some dark miasma of eclipse:<br>
</p>

<p>
Beside an ancient pit he makes her fall, <br>
Where Lazarus, sweet-scented, tears his pall <br>
And wakes the spectral corpse of some now-cold, <br>
Rancid, sepulchral love he knew of old.<br>
</p>

<p>
So when I'm lost to human memory, thrown<br>
In some old gloomy chest to fie alone,<br>
A poor decrepit flask, cracked, abject, crusty<br>
With dirt, opaque and sticky, damp and dusty,<br>
</p>

<p>
I'll be your pall and shroud, beloved pest! <br>
The witness of your venom, and its test, <br>
Dear poison, angel-brewed with deadly art &mdash; <br>
Life, death, and dear corrosion of my heart.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Perfume Flask</b><br>
</p>

<p>
All matter becomes porous to certain scents; they pass<br>
Through everything; it seems they even go through glass.<br>
When opening some old trunk brought home from the far east,<br>
That scolds, feeling the key turned and the lid released &mdash; <br>
</p>

<p>
Some wardrobe, in a house long uninhabited, <br>
Full of the powdery odors of moments that are dead &mdash; <br>
At times, distinct as ever, an old flask will emit <br>
Its perfume; and a soul comes back to live in it.<br>
</p>

<p>
Dormant as chrysalides, a thousand thoughts that lie <br>
In the thick shadows, pulsing imperceptibly, <br>
Now stir, now struggle forth; now their cramped wings unfold, <br>
Tinted with azure, lustred with rose, sheeted with gold!<br>
</p>

<p>
Oh, memories, how you rise and soar, and hover there!<br>
The eyes close; dizziness, in the moth-darkened air,<br>
Seizes the drunken soul, and thrusts it toward the verge &mdash; <br>
Where mistily all human miasmas float and merge &mdash; <br>
</p>

<p>
Of a primeval gulf; and drops it to the ground, <br>
There, where, like Lazarus rising, his grave-clothes half unwound, <br>
And odorous, a cadaver from its sleep has stirred: <br>
An old and rancid love, charming and long-interred.<br>
</p>

<p>
Thus, when I shall be lost from sight, thus when all men<br>
Forget me, in the dark and dusty corner then<br>
Of that most sinister cupboard where the living pile<br>
The dead &mdash; when, an old flask, cracked, sticky, abject, vile,<br>
</p>

<p>
I lie at length &mdash; still, still, sweet pestilence of my heart, <br>
As to what power thou hast, how virulent thou art, <br>
I shall bear witness; safe shall thy dear poison be! <br>
Thou vitriol of the gods! thou death and life of me!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Edna St. Vincent Millay, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Le Flacon</b><br>
</p>

<p>
so keen some fragrances, they freely pass<br>
all barriers. they would pierce a wall of glass.<br>
unlatch a coffer from the Orient<br>
whose creaking hinge will scarcely grant consent,<br>
</p>

<p>
or cupboard in an empty house, where murk,<br>
sharp smells and cobwebs of a century lurk,<br>
thou'lt find perhaps a flask that holds a host<br>
of memories, free perchance a living ghost.<br>
</p>

<p>
crushed in the gloom a thousand keepsakes lay<br>
like coffined larvae there, which, quivering, grey,<br>
released at last arise on soaring wing,<br>
rose-flushed or azure, golden, glittering,<br>
</p>

<p>
and swirling memories mount, to thrill and tease<br>
our closing eyes; we reel in murk, as these<br>
grapple amain and hurl the quailing soul<br>
down to a Pit where human odours roll<br>
</p>

<p>
and fell it on the brink that waits for all,<br>
where, bursting, Lazarus-like, its rotted pall,<br>
stirs and awakes the spectral visage of<br>
a charming, fusty, weird, forgotten love.<br>
</p>

<p>
so when Oblivion blots my memory dim,<br>
and in a corner of a cupboard grim<br>
I like cast off, a sorry flask and old,<br>
crackled and dusty, viscous, green with mould,<br>
</p>

<p>
I'll be thy coffin, lovely pestilence!<br>
I'll prove thy power and thy virulence,<br>
dear poison brewed by angels! dulcet fire<br>
I've drunk, my life, my death, my heart's desire!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Lewis Piaget Shanks, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (New York: Ives Washburn, 1931)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Flask</b>
</p>

<p>
There are some powerful odours that can pass<br>
Out of the stoppered flagon; even glass<br>
To them is porous. Oft when some old box<br>
Brought from the East is opened and the locks<br>
And hinges creak and cry; or in a press<br>
In some deserted house, where the sharp stress<br>
Of odours old and dusty fills the brain;<br>
An ancient flask is brought to light again,<br>
And forth the ghosts of long-dead odours creep.<br>
There, softly trembling in the shadows, sleep<br>
A thousand thoughts, funereal chrysalides,<br>
Phantoms of old the folding darkness hides,<br>
Who make faint flutterings as their wings unfold,<br>
Rose-washed and azure-tinted, shot with gold.<br>
</p>

<p>
A memory that brings languor flutters here:<br>
The fainting eyelids droop, and giddy Fear<br>
Thrusts with both hands the soul towards the pit<br>
Where, like a Lazarus from his winding-sheet,<br>
Arises from the gulf of sleep a ghost<br>
Of an old passion, long since loved and lost.<br>
So I, when vanished from man's memory<br>
Deep in some dark and sombre chest I lie,<br>
An empty flagon they have cast aside,<br>
Broken and soiled, the dust upon my pride,<br>
Will be your shroud, beloved pestilence!<br>
The witness of your might and virulence,<br>
Sweet poison mixed by angels; bitter cup<br>
Of life and death my heart has drunken up!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; F.P. Sturm, from <i>Baudelaire: His Prose and Poetry</i>, edited by Thomas Robert Smith (New York: Boni and Liveright, 1919)
