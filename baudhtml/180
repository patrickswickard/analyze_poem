<b>Femmes Damn&eacute;es (Delphine et Hippolyte)</b><br>
</p>

<p>
&Agrave; la p&acirc;le clart&eacute; des lampes languissantes,<br>
Sur de profonds coussins tout impr&eacute;gn&eacute;s d'odeur <br>
Hippolyte r&ecirc;vait aux caresses puissantes <br>
Qui levaient le rideau de sa jeune candeur. <br>
</p>

<p>
Elle cherchait, d'un oeil troubl&eacute; par la temp&ecirc;te, <br>
De sa na&iuml;vet&eacute; le ciel d&eacute;j&agrave; lointain, <br>
Ainsi qu'un voyageur qui retourne la t&ecirc;te <br>
Vers les horizons bleus d&eacute;pass&eacute;s le matin. <br>
</p>

<p>
De ses yeux amortis les paresseuses larmes, <br>
L'air bris&eacute;, la stupeur, la morne volupt&eacute;, <br>
Ses bras vaincus, jet&eacute;s comme de vaines armes, <br>
Tout servait, tout parait sa fragile beaut&eacute;. <br>
</p>

<p>
&Eacute;tendue &agrave; ses pieds, calme et pleine de joie,<br>
Delphine la couvait avec des yeux ardents, <br>
Comme un animal fort qui surveille une proie, <br>
Apr&egrave;s l'avoir d'abord marqu&eacute;e avec les dents. <br>
</p>

<p>
Beaut&eacute; forte &agrave; genoux devant la beaut&eacute; fr&ecirc;le, <br>
Superbe, elle humait voluptueusement <br>
Le vin de son triomphe, et s'allongeait vers elle, <br>
Comme pour recueillir un doux remerciement. <br>
</p>

<p>
Elle cherchait dans l'oeil de sa p&acirc;le victime <br>
Le cantique muet que chante le plaisir, <br>
Et cette gratitude infinie et sublime <br>
Qui sort de la paupi&egrave;re ainsi qu'un long soupir. <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; &laquo;Hippolyte, cher coeur, que dis-tu de ces choses? <br>
Comprends-tu maintenant qu'il ne faut pas offrir <br>
L'holocauste sacr&eacute; de tes premi&egrave;res roses <br>
Aux souffles violents qui pourraient les fl&eacute;trir ? <br>
</p>

<p>
Mes baisers sont l&eacute;gers comme ces &eacute;ph&eacute;m&egrave;res <br>
Qui caressent le soir les grands lacs transparents, <br>
Et ceux de ton amant creuseront leurs orni&egrave;res <br>
Comme des chariots ou des socs d&eacute;chirants; <br>
</p>

<p>
Ils passeront sur toi comme un lourd attelage <br>
De chevaux et de boeufs aux sabots sans piti&eacute;... <br>
Hippolyte, &ocirc; ma soeur! tourne donc ton visage, <br>
Toi, mon &acirc;me et mon coeur, mon tout et ma moiti&eacute;, <br>
</p>

<p>
Tourne vers moi tes yeux pleins d'azur et d'&eacute;toiles! <br>
Pour un de ces regards charmants, baume divin, <br>
Des plaisirs plus obscurs je l&egrave;verai les voiles, <br>
Et je t'endormirai dans un r&ecirc;ve sans fin!&raquo; <br>
</p>

<p>
Mais Hippolyte alors, levant sa jeune t&ecirc;te: <br>
&mdash; &laquo;Je ne suis point ingrate et ne me repens pas, <br>
Ma Delphine, je souffre et je suis inqui&egrave;te, <br>
Comme apr&egrave;s un nocturne et terrible repas. <br>
</p>

<p>
Je sens fondre sur moi de lourdes &eacute;pouvantes <br>
Et de noirs bataillons de fant&ocirc;mes &eacute;pars, <br>
Qui veulent me conduire en des routes mouvantes <br>
Qu'un horizon sanglant ferme de toutes parts. <br>
</p>

<p>
Avons-nous donc commis une action &eacute;trange ? <br>
Explique, si tu peux, mon trouble et mon effroi: <br>
Je frissonne de peur quand tu me dis: 'Mon ange!' <br>
Et cependant je sens ma bouche aller vers toi. <br>
</p>

<p>
Ne me regarde pas ainsi, toi, ma pens&eacute;e! <br>
Toi que j'aime &agrave; jamais, ma soeur d'&eacute;lection, <br>
Quand m&ecirc;me tu serais une emb&ucirc;che dress&eacute;e <br>
Et le commencement de ma perdition!&raquo; <br>
</p>

<p>
Delphine secouant sa crini&egrave;re tragique, <br>
Et comme tr&eacute;pignant sur le tr&eacute;pied de fer, <br>
L'oeil fatal, r&eacute;pondit d'une voix despotique: <br>
&mdash; &laquo;Qui donc devant l'amour ose parler d'enfer ? <br>
</p>

<p>
Maudit soit &agrave; jamais le r&ecirc;veur inutile <br>
Qui voulut le premier, dans sa stupidit&eacute;, <br>
S'&eacute;prenant d'un probl&egrave;me insoluble et st&eacute;rile, <br>
Aux choses de l'amour m&ecirc;ler l'honn&ecirc;tet&eacute;! <br>
</p>

<p>
Celui qui veut unir dans un accord mystique <br>
L'ombre avec la chaleur, la nuit avec le jour, <br>
Ne chauffera jamais son corps paralytique <br>
&Agrave; ce rouge soleil que l'on nomme l'amour! <br>
</p>

<p>
Va, si tu veux, chercher un fianc&eacute; stupide; <br>
Cours offrir un coeur vierge &agrave; ses cruels baisers; <br>
Et, pleine de remords et d'horreur, et livide, <br>
Tu me rapporteras tes seins stigmatis&eacute;s... <br>
</p>

<p>
On ne peut ici-bas contenter qu'un seul ma&icirc;tre!&raquo; <br>
Mais l'enfant, &eacute;panchant une immense douleur, <br>
Cria soudain: &mdash; &laquo;Je sens s'&eacute;largir dans mon &ecirc;tre <br>
Un ab&icirc;me b&eacute;ant; cet ab&icirc;me est mon coeur! <br>
</p>

<p>
Br&ucirc;lant comme un volcan, profond comme le vide! <br>
Rien ne rassasiera ce monstre g&eacute;missant <br>
Et ne rafra&icirc;chira la soif de l'Eum&eacute;nide <br>
Qui, la torche &agrave; la main, le br&ucirc;le jusqu'au sang. <br>
</p>

<p>
Que nos rideaux ferm&eacute;s nous s&eacute;parent du monde, <br>
Et que la lassitude am&egrave;ne le repos! <br>
Je veux m'an&eacute;antir dans ta gorge profonde, <br>
Et trouver sur ton sein la fra&icirc;cheur des tombeaux!&raquo; <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Descendez, descendez, lamentables victimes, <br>
Descendez le chemin de l'enfer &eacute;ternel! <br>
Plongez au plus profond du gouffre, o&ugrave; tous les crimes <br>
Flagell&eacute;s par un vent qui ne vient pas du ciel, <br>
</p>

<p>
Bouillonnent p&ecirc;le-m&ecirc;le avec un bruit d'orage. <br>
Ombres folles, courez au but de vos d&eacute;sirs; <br>
Jamais vous ne pourrez assouvir votre rage, <br>
Et votre ch&acirc;timent na&icirc;tra de vos plaisirs. <br>
</p>

<p>
Jamais un rayon frais n'&eacute;claira vos cavernes; <br>
Par les fentes des murs des miasmes fi&eacute;vreux <br>
Filtrent en s'enflammant ainsi que des lanternes <br>
Et p&eacute;n&egrave;trent vos corps de leurs parfums affreux. <br>
</p>

<p>
L'&acirc;pre st&eacute;rilit&eacute; de votre jouissance <br>
Alt&egrave;re votre soif et roidit votre peau, <br>
Et le vent furibond de la concupiscence <br>
Fait claquer votre chair ainsi qu'un vieux drapeau. <br>
</p>

<p>
Loin des peuples vivants, errantes, condamn&eacute;es, <br>
&Agrave; travers les d&eacute;serts courez comme les loups; <br>
Faites votre destin, &acirc;mes d&eacute;sordonn&eacute;es, <br>
Et fuyez l'infini que vous portez en vous! <br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>Damned Women</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Delphine and Hippolyta<br>
</p>

<p>
In the pallid light of languishing lamps, <br>
In deep cushions redolent of perfume, <br>
Hippolyta dreamed of the potent caresses <br>
That drew aside the veil of her young innocence.<br>
</p>

<p>
She was seeking, with an eye disturbed by the storm, <br>
The already distant skies of her naivet&eacute;, <br>
Like a voyager who turns to look back <br>
Toward the blue horizons passed early in the day.<br>
</p>

<p>
The listless tears from her lacklustrous eyes, <br>
The beaten, bewildered look, the dulled delight, <br>
Her defeated arms thrown wide like futile weapons, <br>
All served, all adorned her fragile beauty.<br>
</p>

<p>
Lying at her feet, calm and filled with joy, <br>
Delphine gazed at her hungrily, with burning eyes, <br>
Like a strong animal watching a prey <br>
Which it has already marked with its teeth.<br>
</p>

<p>
The strong beauty kneeling before the frail beauty, <br>
Superb, she savored voluptuously <br>
The wine of her triumph and stretched out toward the girl <br>
As if to reap her reward of sweet thankfulness.<br>
</p>

<p>
She was seeking in the eyes of her pale victim <br>
The silent canticle that pleasure sings <br>
And that gratitude, sublime and infinite, <br>
Which the eyes give forth like a long drawn sigh.<br>
</p>

<p>
"Hippolyta, sweet, what do you think of our love? <br>
Do you understand now that you need not offer <br>
The sacred burnt-offering of your first roses <br>
To a violent breath which could make them wither?<br>
</p>

<p>
My kisses are as light as the touch of May flies <br>
That caress in the evening the great limpid lakes, <br>
But those of your lover will dig furrows <br>
As a wagon does, or a tearing ploughshare;<br>
</p>

<p>
They will pass over you like heavy teams<br>
Of horses or oxen, with cruel iron-shod hooves...<br>
Hippolyta, sister! please turn your face to me,<br>
You, my heart and soul, my all, half of my own self,<br>
</p>

<p>
Turn toward me your eyes brimming with azure and stars! <br>
For one of those bewitching looks, O divine balm, <br>
I will lift the veil of the more subtle pleasures <br>
And lull you to sleep in an endless dream!"<br>
</p>

<p>
Hippolyta then raised her youthful head: <br>
"I am not ungrateful and I do not repent, <br>
Delphine darling; I feel restless and ill, <br>
As I do after a rich midnight feast.<br>
</p>

<p>
I feel heavy terrors pouncing on me <br>
And black battalions of scattered phantoms <br>
Who wish to lead me onto shifting roads <br>
That a bloody horizon shuts in on all sides.<br>
</p>

<p>
Is there something strange in what we have done? <br>
Explain if you can my confusion and my fright: <br>
I shudder with fear when you say: 'My angel!' <br>
And yet I feel my mouth moving toward you.<br>
</p>

<p>
Do not look at me that way, you, my dearest thought: <br>
The sister of my choice whom I'd love forever <br>
Even if you were an ambush prepared for me <br>
And the beginning of my perdition."<br>
</p>

<p>
Delphine, shaking her tragic mane and stamping her foot <br>
As if she were stamping on the iron Tripod, <br>
Her eyes fatal, replied in a despotic voice: <br>
"Who dares to speak of hell in the presence of love?<br>
</p>

<p>
May he be cursed forever, that idle dreamer,<br>
The first one who in his stupidity<br>
Entranced by a sterile, insoluble problem,<br>
Wished to mix honesty with what belongs to love!<br>
</p>

<p>
He who would unite in a mystic harmony<br>
Coolness with warmth and the night with the day<br>
Will never warm his palsied flesh<br>
With that red sun whose name is love!<br>
</p>

<p>
Go if you wish and find a stupid sweetheart, run<br>
To offer your virgin heart to his cruel kisses;<br>
Full of remorse and horror, and livid,<br>
You will bring back to me your stigmatized breasts...<br>
</p>

<p>
Woman here below can serve only one master!" <br>
But the girl pouring out the vast grief in her heart, <br>
Suddenly cried: "I feel opening within me <br>
A yawning abyss; that abyss is my heart!<br>
</p>

<p>
Burning like a volcano and deep as the void! <br>
Nothing will satiate that wailing monster <br>
Nor cool the thirst of the Eumenides <br>
Who with torch in hand burn his very blood.<br>
</p>

<p>
Let our drawn curtains separate us from the world<br>
And let lassitude bring to us repose!<br>
I want to bury my head in your deep bosom<br>
And find in your breast the cool of the tomb!"<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Go down, go down, lamentable victims,<br>
Go down the pathway to eternal hell!<br>
Plunge to the bottom of the abyss where all crime<br>
Whipped by a wind that comes not from heaven,<br>
</p>

<p>
Boil pell-mell with the sound of a tempest. <br>
Mad shades, run to the goal of your desires; <br>
You will never be able to sate your passion <br>
And your punishment will be born of your pleasures.<br>
</p>

<p>
Never will a cool ray light your caverns; <br>
Through the chinks in the walls feverish miasmas <br>
Filter through, burst into flame like lanterns <br>
And permeate your bodies with frightful odors.<br>
</p>

<p>
The bleak sterility of your pleasures <br>
Increases your thirst and makes your skin taut <br>
And the raging wind of carnal desire <br>
Makes your flesh snap like an old flag.<br>
</p>

<p>
Damned, wandering, far from living people,<br>
Roam like the wolves across the desert waste;<br>
Fulfill your destinies, dissolute souls,<br>
And flee the infinite you carry in your hearts!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Damned Women</b>
</p>

<p>
Delphine and Hippolyta<br>
</p>

<p>
Over deep cushions, drenched with drowsy scents <br>
Where fading lamplight shed its dying glow, <br>
Hippolyta recalls and half-repents <br>
The kisses that first thawed her youthful snow.<br>
</p>

<p>
She sought, with tempest-troubled gaze, the skies <br>
Of her first innocence, now far away, <br>
As travellers who backward turn their eyes <br>
To blue horizons passed at break of day.<br>
</p>

<p>
Within her haggard eyes the tears were bright. <br>
Her broken look, her dazed, voluptuous air, <br>
Her vanquished arms like weapons shed in Right, <br>
Enhanced her fragile beauty with despair.<br>
</p>

<p>
Stretched at her feet Delphine contented lay <br>
And watched with burning eyeballs from beneath <br>
Like a fierce tigress who, to guard her prey, <br>
Has set a mark upon it with her teeth.<br>
</p>

<p>
Strong beauty there to fragile beauty kneeling, <br>
Superb, she seemed to sniff the heady wine <br>
Of triumph: and stretched out to her, appealing <br>
For the reward of raptures half-divine.<br>
</p>

<p>
She sought within her victim's pallid eye <br>
Dumb hymns that pleasure sings without a choir, <br>
And gratitude that, like a long-drawn sigh, <br>
Swells from the eyelid, swooning with fire.<br>
</p>

<p>
"Hippolyta, dear heart, have you no trust? <br>
Do you not know the folly that exposes <br>
To the fierce pillage of the brawling gust <br>
The sacred holocaust of early roses?<br>
</p>

<p>
My kisses are as light as fairy midges <br>
That on calm evenings skim the crystal lake. <br>
Those of your man would plough such ruts and ridge <br>
As lumbering carts or tearing coulters make.<br>
</p>

<p>
They'll tramp across you, like a ruthless team <br>
Of buffaloes or horses, yoked in lust. <br>
Dear sister, turn your face to me, my dream, <br>
My soul, my all, my twin, to whom I trust!<br>
</p>

<p>
Turn me your eyes of deepest, starry blue. <br>
For one of those deep glances that you send, <br>
I'd lift the veil of darkest joys for you <br>
And rock you in a dream that has no end."<br>
</p>

<p>
But then Hippolyta raised up her head, <br>
"No blame nor base ingratitude I feel, <br>
But, as it were, a kind of nauseous dread <br>
After some terrible, nocturnal meal.<br>
</p>

<p>
I feel a swooping terror that explodes <br>
In legions of black ghosts towards me speeding <br>
Who crowd me on to swiftly moving roads, <br>
That, sliced by sheer horizons, end up bleeding.<br>
</p>

<p>
Have we done something monstrous that I tremble?<br>
Explain, then, if you can; for when you say,<br>
'Angel', I cower. Yet I cannot dissemble<br>
That, when you speak, my lips are drawn your way.<br>
</p>

<p>
Oh, do not fix me with a stare so steady <br>
You whom I love till death in still submission, <br>
Yes, even though you, like an ambush ready, <br>
Are the beginning of my own perdition."<br>
</p>

<p>
Then Delphine stamped and shook her tragic mane, <br>
And, like a priestess, foaming and fierce, and fell, <br>
Spoke in a lordly and prophetic strain<br>
&mdash; "Who dares, in front of Love, to mention Hell?<br>
</p>

<p>
Curbed forever be that useless dreamer <br>
Who first imagined, in his brutish mind, <br>
Of sheer futility the fatuous schemer, <br>
Honour with Love could ever be combined.<br>
</p>

<p>
He who in mystic union would enmesh <br>
Shadow with warmth, and daytime with the night, <br>
Will never warm his paralytic flesh <br>
At the red sun of amorous delight.<br>
</p>

<p>
Go, if you wish, and seek some boorish lover:<br>
Offer your virgin heart to his crude hold,<br>
Full of remorse and horror you'll recover,<br>
And bring me your scarred breast to be consoled...<br>
</p>

<p>
Down here, a soul can only serve one master." <br>
But the girl, venting her tremendous woe, <br>
Cried out "I feel a huge pit of disaster <br>
Yawning within: it is my heart, I know!<br>
</p>

<p>
Like a volcano burning, deep as death, <br>
There's naught that groaning monster can assuage <br>
Nor quench of thirst the Fury's burning breath <br>
Who brands it with a torch to make it rage.<br>
</p>

<p>
Let our closed curtains isolate the rest, <br>
Until exhaustion bring us sleep, while I <br>
Annihilate myself upon your breast <br>
And find in you a tomb on which to die."<br>
</p>

<p>
Go down, go down, poor victims, it is time; <br>
The road to endless hell awaits your lusts. <br>
Plunge to the bottom of the gulf, where crime <br>
Is flagellated by infernal gusts.<br>
</p>

<p>
Swirling pell-mell, and with a tempest's roar, <br>
Mad shades, pursue your craving without measure: <br>
Your rages will be sated nevermore, <br>
Your torture is begotten of your pleasure.<br>
</p>

<p>
No sunbeam through your dungeon will come leaking: <br>
Only miasmic fevers, through each chink, <br>
Will filter, like sick lanterns, redly streaking, <br>
And penetrate your bodies with their stink.<br>
</p>

<p>
The harsh sterility of all you relish <br>
Will swell your thirst, and turn you both to hags. <br>
The wind of your desire, with fury hellish <br>
Will flog your flapping carrion like wet flags.<br>
</p>

<p>
Far from live folk, like werewolves howling high, <br>
Gallop the boundless deserts you unroll. <br>
Fulfill your doom, disordered minds, and fly <br>
The infinite you carry in your soul.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>

<br>


<p>
<b>Delphine and Hippolyte</b><br>
</p>

<p>
The lamps had languisht and their light was pale;<br>
On cushions deep Hippolyta reclined.<br>
Those potent kisses that had torn the veil<br>
From her young candour filled her dreaming mind.<br>
</p>

<p>
With tempest-troubled eyes she sought the blue<br>
Heaven of her innocence, how far away!<br>
Like some sad traveller, who turns to view<br>
The dim horizons passed at dawn of day.<br>
</p>

<p>
Tears and the muffled light of weary eyes,<br>
The stupor and the dull voluptuous trance,<br>
Limp arms, like weapons dropped by one who flies &mdash;<br>
All served her fragile beauty to enhance.<br>
</p>

<p>
Calm at her feet and joyful, Delphine lay<br>
And gazed at her with ardent eyes and bright,<br>
Like some strong beast that, having mauled its prey, <br>
Draws back to mark the imprint of its bite.<br>
</p>

<p>
Strong and yet bowed, superbly on her knees,<br>
She snuffed her triumph, on that frailer grace<br>
Poring voluptuously, as though to seize<br>
The signs of thanks upon the other's face.<br>
</p>

<p>
Gazing, she sought in her pale victim's eye<br>
The speechless canticle that pleasure sings,<br>
The infinite gratitude that, like a sigh, <br>
Mounts slowly from the spirit's deepest springs.<br>
</p>

<p>
"Now, now you understand (for love like ours<br>
Is proof enough) that 'twere a sin to throw<br>
The sacred holocaust of your first flowers<br>
To those whose breath might parch them as they blow.<br>
</p>

<p>
Light falls my kiss, as the ephemeral wing<br>
That scarcely stirs the shining of a lake.<br>
What ruinous pain your lover's kiss would bring!<br>
A plough that leaves a furrow in its wake.<br>
</p>

<p>
Over you, like a herd of ponderous kine,<br>
Man's love will pass and his caresses fall,<br>
Like trampling hooves. Then turn your face to mine;<br>
Turn, oh my heart, my half of me, my all!<br>
</p>

<p>
Turn, turn, that I may see their starry lights,<br>
Your eyes of azure; turn. For one dear glance<br>
I will reveal your love's most obscure delights,<br>
And you shall drowse in pleasure's endless trance."<br>
</p>

<p>
"Not thankless, nor repentant in the least<br>
Is your Hippolyta." She raised her head.<br>
"But one whom from some grim nocturnal feast<br>
Returns at dawn feels less disquieted.<br>
</p>

<p>
I bear a weight of terrors, and dark hosts<br>
Of phantoms haunt my steps and seem to lead.<br>
I walk, compelled, behind these beckoning ghosts<br>
Down sliding roads and under skies that bleed.<br>
</p>

<p>
Is ours so strange an act, so full of shame?<br>
Explain the terrors that disturb my bliss.<br>
When you say, Love, I tremble at the name;<br>
And yet my mouth is thirsty for your kiss.<br>
</p>

<p>
Ah, look not so, dear sister, look not so!<br>
You whom I love, even though that love should be<br>
A snare for my undoing, even though<br>
Loving I am lost for all eternity."<br>
</p>

<p>
Delphine looked up, and fate was in her eye.<br>
From the god's tripod and beneath his spell,<br>
Shaking her tragic locks, she made reply:<br>
"Who in love's presence dares to speak of hell?<br>
</p>

<p>
Thinker of useless thoughts, let him be cursed<br>
Who in his folly, venturing to vex<br>
A question answerless and barren, first<br>
With wrong and right involved the things of sex!<br>
</p>

<p>
He who in mystical accord conjoins<br>
Shadow with heat, dusk with the noon's high fire,<br>
Shall never warm the palsy of his loins<br>
At that red sun which mortals desire.<br>
</p>

<p>
Go, seek some lubber groom's deflowering lust;<br>
Take him your heart and leave me here despised!<br>
Go &mdash; and bring back, all horror and disgust,<br>
The livid breasts man's love has stigmatized.<br>
</p>

<p>
One may not serve two masters here below."<br>
But the child answered: "I am torn apart,<br>
I feel my inmost being rent, as though<br>
A gulf had yawned &mdash; the gulf that is my heart.<br>
</p>

<p>
Naught may this monster's desperate thirst assuage, &mdash;<br>
As fire 'tis hot, as space itself profound &mdash;<br>
Naught stay the Fury from her quenchless rage,<br>
Who with her torch explores its bleeding wound.<br>
</p>

<p>
Curtain the world away and let us try<br>
If lassitude will bring the boon of rest.<br>
In your deep bosom I would sink and die,<br>
Would find the grave's fresh coolness on your breast."<br>
</p>

<p>
Hence, lamentable victims, get you hence!<br>
Hells yawn beneath, your road is straight and steep.<br>
Where all the crimes receive their recompense<br>
Wind-whipped and seething in the lowest deep<br>
</p>

<p>
With a huge roaring as of storms and fires,<br>
Go down, mad phantoms, doomed to seek in vain<br>
The ne-er-won goal of unassuaged desires,<br>
And in your pleasures find eternal pain!<br>
</p>

<p>
Sunless your caverns are; the fever damps<br>
That filter in through every crannied vent<br>
Break out with marsh-fire into sudden lamps<br>
And steep your bodies with their frightful scent.<br>
</p>

<p>
The barrenness of pleasures harsh and stale<br>
Makes mad your thirst and parches up your skin;<br>
And like an old flag volleying in the gale,<br>
Your whole flesh shudders in the blasts of sin.<br>
</p>

<p>
Far from your kind, outlawed and reprobate,<br>
Go, prowl like wolves through desert worlds apart!<br>
Disordered souls, fashion your own dark fate,<br>
And flee the god you carry in your heart.<br>
</p>

<p>

<p>
<b>Lovers of the Damned</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Under pale flickering lamps, deep in recesses <br>
Of lissome cushions of suave redolence, <br>
Hippolyta mused of the fierce caresses <br>
That raised the veils of her young innocence.<br>
</p>

<p>
Her gaze still ravaged by the storm, she eyed <br>
The distant sides of her once candid mind <br>
As a spent voyager who turns aside <br>
To view blue vistas he has left behind.<br>
</p>

<p>
The lazy tears in her lackluster glances, <br>
Her beaten stuporous air, her weariness, <br>
Her aching arms drooping like futile lances, <br>
All served to foster her frail loveliness.<br>
</p>

<p>
Rapt with calm joy, Delphine, her lover, lay <br>
Prone at her feet; eyes blazing with delight, <br>
She was a strong beast gazing at the prey <br>
On which her teeth had marked their savage bite.<br>
</p>

<p>
Strong beauty knelt before frail beauty there &mdash; <br>
Superb, she savored with voluptuous mood <br>
The wine of triumph, and, as though in prayer, <br>
Her hands solicited sweet gratitude.<br>
</p>

<p>
She scanned her dupe's pale glance to find in it <br>
The muted hymn lust raises to the skies, <br>
And thankfulness, sublime and infinite, <br>
Which glances utter soft as long-drawn sighs.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; &quot;Hippolyta, what of this strange sweet thing? <br>
You need not sully your first roses now <br>
To brutal man as a burnt-offering <br>
His violent breath would wither on the bough.<br>
</p>

<p>
My kiss moves lightly as a May fly moves, <br>
Caressing the great limpid lakes at eve, <br>
But a man's kisses will dig furrowed grooves <br>
Such as huge carts or tearing plowshares leave.<br>
</p>

<p>
They will pass over you like stamping kine, <br>
Like ox or horse teams cruelly iron-shod, <br>
Hippolyta, turn your blest face toward mine, Y<br>
ou, dearer to my heart than self or God.<br>
</p>

<p>
Your eyes are stars across soft azure nights, <br>
One look from you and I shall lift extreme <br>
Veils to reveal the subtlest of delights, <br>
Cradling you gently in an endless dream.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>
Hippolyta then raised her youthful head:<br>
&mdash; &quot;No ingrate, I repent not in the least, <br>
Delphine, but I feel choked and ill,&quot; she said, <br>
&quot;As after some galling nocturnal feast.<br>
</p>

<p>
I feel grim fears, I reel under their loads, <br>
While black battalions of sparse phantoms stride, <br>
Eager to lead me down dire, shifting roads, <br>
Which bloody sky-rims block on every side.<br>
</p>

<p>
What could be strange in what we did tonight? <br>
Why all my worries and discomfitures? <br>
You call me "Angel" and I start with fright, <br>
And yet I feel my mouth straining for yours!<br>
</p>

<p>
Do not look at me thus, sister to whom <br>
By choice I pledged eternal adoration, <br>
Even were you a snare set for my doom <br>
And the first instrument of my damnation.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>
Shaking her tragic mane, rapt, fatal-eyed, <br>
Stamping her foot as on the Tripod of <br>
The Oracle, Delphine, despotic, cried:<br>
&mdash; &quot;Who dares to speak of hell when faced with love?<br>
</p>

<p>
Curst be the first vain dreamer who evolved <br>
A sterile code of laws and stupidly <br>
Thrilled by vexed problems that cannot be solved <br>
Sought to compound love and morality.<br>
</p>

<p>
He who would couple in a mystic mesh <br>
Coolness with heat and marry day with night <br>
Shall never warm his palsy-stricken flesh <br>
In that red sun which is our love's delight.<br>
</p>

<p>
Go find a stupid lover, do not fail<br>
To yield your chaste heart to his harsh requests,<br>
Then horrified, remorseful, ashen-pale,<br>
Return to me with bruised stigmatic breasts.<br>
</p>

<p>
Woman on earth can serve only one master!... &quot;<br>
But the girl answered: &quot;All my senses smart!<br>
I feel sharp premonitions of disaster, <br>
A pit yawns in me, and that pit, my heart!<br>
</p>

<p>
Volcano-hot and deep as nullity, <br>
Nothing will stay this monster's headlong flood <br>
Nor slake the thirst of that Eumenide <br>
Who, torch in hand, consumes his very blood.<br>
</p>

<p>
Let our drawn curtains screen us from alarms, <br>
And let our lassitude bring us full rest, <br>
I wish to die between your sinewy arms <br>
And find the cool of tombs upon your breast.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>
Go down, go down, sad victims to the climes<br>
Of an eternal hell, all hope is dead;<br>
Down the unfathomed pit where all known crimes,<br>
Lashed by a wind no heaven ever bred,<br>
</p>

<p>
Boil to the fury of the tempest's blast. <br>
The goal of your desires shall turn to dust, <br>
Mad, raging shades, unsated to the last, <br>
Your very punishment born of your lust.<br>
</p>

<p>
No ray shall light the caverns of your shame, <br>
Fevered miasms filtering through the chinks <br>
Shall suddenly like lamps burst into flame, <br>
Steeping your bodies in a sweat that stinks.<br>
</p>

<p>
The bleak sterility of your lewd fires <br>
Heightens your thirst and tightens skins that sag, <br>
As the wild wind of lecherous desires <br>
Makes your flesh flap like a moth-eaten flag.<br>
</p>

<p>
Outcast and damned, wandering the far poles, <br>
Like wolves the frozen wilderness disparts, <br>
Follow your destiny, disordered souls, <br>
And flee the infinite that fills your hearts.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jacques LeClercq, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (Mt Vernon, NY: Peter Pauper Press, 1958)<br>

Two editions of <i>Fleurs du mal</i> were published in Baudelaire's lifetime &mdash; one in 1857 and an expanded edition in 1861. "Scraps" and censored poems were collected in <i>Les &Eacute;paves</i> in 1866. After Baudelaire died the following year, a "definitive" edition appeared in 1868.
