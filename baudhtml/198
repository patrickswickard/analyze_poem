<b>La Mort des pauvres</b><br>
</p>

<p>
C'est la Mort qui console, h&eacute;las! et qui fait vivre;<br>
C'est le but de la vie, et c'est le seul espoir<br>
Qui, comme un &eacute;lixir, nous monte et nous enivre,<br>
Et nous donne le coeur de marcher jusqu'au soir;<br>
</p>

<p>
&Agrave; travers la temp&ecirc;te, et la neige, et le givre,<br>
C'est la clart&eacute; vibrante &agrave; notre horizon noir<br>
C'est l'auberge fameuse inscrite sur le livre,<br>
O&ugrave; l'on pourra manger, et dormir, et s'asseoir;<br>
</p>

<p>
C'est un Ange qui tient dans ses doigts magn&eacute;tiques<br>
Le sommeil et le don des r&ecirc;ves extatiques,<br>
Et qui refait le lit des gens pauvres et nus;<br>
</p>

<p>
C'est la gloire des Dieux, c'est le grenier mystique,<br>
C'est la bourse du pauvre et sa patrie antique,<br>
C'est le portique ouvert sur les Cieux inconnus!<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>The Death of the Poor</b><br>
</p>

<p>
It's Death that comforts us, alas! and makes us live; <br>
It is the goal of life; it is the only hope <br>
Which, like an elixir, makes us inebriate <br>
And gives us the courage to march until evening;<br>
</p>

<p>
Through the storm and the snow and the hoar-frost <br>
It is the vibrant light on our black horizon; <br>
It is the famous inn inscribed upon the book, <br>
Where one can eat, and sleep, and take his rest;<br>
</p>

<p>
It's an Angel who holds in his magnetic hands <br>
Sleep and the gift of ecstatic dreams <br>
And who makes the beds for the poor, naked people;<br>
</p>

<p>
It's the glory of the gods, the mystic granary, <br>
It is the poor man's purse, his ancient fatherland, <br>
It is the portal opening on unknown Skies!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Death of Paupers</b>
</p>

<p>
It's Death comforts us, alas! and makes us live. <br>
It is the goal of life, it brings us hope, <br>
And, like a rich elixir, seems to give <br>
Courage to march along the darkening slope.<br>
</p>

<p>
Across the tempest, hail, and hoarfrost, look!<br>
Along the black horizon, a faint gleam!<br>
It is the inn that's written in the book<br>
Where one can sleep, and eat, and sit and dream.<br>
</p>

<p>
An Angel, in magnetic hands it holds <br>
Sleep and the gift of sweet ecstatic dreams, <br>
And makes a bed for poor and naked souls.<br>
</p>

<p>
It is God's glory and the mystic grange: <br>
The poor man's purse and fatherland it seems, <br>
And door that opens Heavens vast and strange.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>


<p>
<b>The Death of the Poor</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Death? Death is our one comfort! &mdash; is the bread whereby <br>
We live, the wine that warms us when all hope is gone; <br>
The very goal of Life. That we shall one day die: <br>
This is the thought which gives us courage to go on.<br>
</p>

<p>
Clear on the black horizon, through the blinding sleet, <br>
That beacon burns; &mdash; oh, Death, thou inn of wide renown! <br>
Is it not written in the book: "Here all may eat; <br>
Here there is rest for all; here all may sit them down?"<br>
</p>

<p>
Thou hovering Angel, holding in thy magic hand <br>
Slumber and blissful dreams; thou Glory overhead; <br>
Mysterious attic, filled with treasures manifold;<br>
</p>

<p>
The poor man's purse, and his remembered fatherland; <br>
Thou, that remakest nightly the beggar's crumpled bed; <br>
Thou only door ajar, pledge of the peace foretold!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Edna St. Vincent Millay, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Death of the Poor</b>
</p>

<p>
It is Death that consoles &mdash; yea, and causes our lives;<br>
'Tis the goal of this Life and of Hope the sole ray, <br>
Which like a strong potion enlivens and gives <br>
Us the strength to plod on to the end of the day. <br>
</p>

<p>
And all through the tempest, the frost and the snows, <br>
'Tis the shimmering light on our black sky-line;<br>
'Tis the famous inn which the guide-book shows, <br>
Whereat one can eat, and sleep, and recline;<br>
</p>

<p>
'Tis an angel that holds in his magic hands <br>
The sleep, which ecstatic dream commands, <br>
Who remakes up the beds of the naked and poor;<br>
</p>

<p>
'Tis the fame of the gods, 'tis the granary blest, <br>
'Tis the purse of the poor, and his birth-place of rest, <br>
To the unknown Heavens, 'tis the wide-open door. <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Cyril Scott, <i>Baudelaire: The Flowers of Evil</i> (London: Elkin Mathews, 1909)
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>La Mort des pauvres</b><br>
</p>

<p>
'tis Death that helps us live, 'tis Death consoles;<br>
Death is life's goal; 'tis the one hope that cheers,<br>
and, like a cordial, spurs our slackening souls,<br>
bestowing strength to march till night appears;<br>
</p>

<p>
through snow and hoar-frost, where the tempest rolls<br>
toward the black hills, Death's leaping fire veers;<br>
Death is the famous Inn the Book extols,<br>
where we shall dine and rest among our peers;<br>
</p>

<p>
Death is an angel, with his fingers full<br>
of magic sleep and dreams most wonderful,<br>
&mdash; who smoothes the bed whereon the beggar lies;<br>
</p>

<p>
Death is the glory of the gods, the gold<br>
all poor folk hoard, their fatherland of old,<br>
Death is the portal wide to unknown skies!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Lewis Piaget Shanks, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (New York: Ives Washburn, 1931)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Death of the Poor</b>
</p>

<p>
Death is consoler and Death brings to life;<br>
The end of all, the solitary hope;<br>
We, drunk with Death's elixir, face the strife,<br>
Take heart, and mount till eve the weary slope.<br>
</p>

<p>
Across the storm, the hoar-frost, and the snow,<br>
Death on our dark horizon pulses clear;<br>
Death is the famous hostel we all know,<br>
Where we may rest and sleep and have good cheer.<br>
</p>

<p>
Death is an angel whose magnetic palms<br>
Bring dreams of ecstasy and slumberous calms<br>
To smooth the beds of naked men and poor.<br>
</p>

<p>
Death is the mystic granary of God;<br>
The poor man's purse; his fatherland of yore;<br>
The Gate that opens into heavens untrod!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; F.P. Sturm, from <i>Baudelaire: His Prose and Poetry</i>, edited by Thomas Robert Smith (New York: Boni and Liveright, 1919)

Two editions of <i>Fleurs du mal</i> were published in Baudelaire's lifetime &mdash; one in 1857 and an expanded edition in 1861. "Scraps" and censored poems were collected in <i>Les &Eacute;paves</i> in 1866. After Baudelaire died the following year, a "definitive" edition appeared in 1868.
