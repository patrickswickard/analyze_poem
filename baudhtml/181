<b>Femmes damn&eacute;es</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Comme un b&eacute;tail pensif sur le sable couch&eacute;es,<br>
Elles tournent leurs yeux vers l'horizon des mers,<br>
Et leurs pieds se cherchant et leurs mains rapproch&eacute;es<br>
Ont de douces langueurs et des frissons amers.<br>
</p>

<p>
Les unes, coeurs &eacute;pris des longues confidences,<br>
Dans le fond des bosquets o&ugrave; jasent les ruisseaux,<br>
Vont &eacute;pelant l'amour des craintives enfances<br>
Et creusent le bois vert des jeunes arbrisseaux;<br>
</p>

<p>
D'autres, comme des soeurs, marchent lentes et graves<br>
&Agrave; travers les rochers pleins d'apparitions,<br>
O&ugrave; saint Antoine a vu surgir comme des laves<br>
Les seins nus et pourpr&eacute;s de ses tentations;<br>
</p>

<p>
II en est, aux lueurs des r&eacute;sines croulantes,<br>
Qui dans le creux muet des vieux antres pa&iuml;ens<br>
T'appellent au secours de leurs fi&egrave;vres hurlantes,<br>
&Ocirc; Bacchus, endormeur des remords anciens!<br>
</p>

<p>
Et d'autres, dont la gorge aime les scapulaires,<br>
Qui, rec&eacute;lant un fouet sous leurs longs v&ecirc;tements,<br>
M&ecirc;lent, dans le bois sombre et les nuits solitaires,<br>
L'&eacute;cume du plaisir aux larmes des tourments.<br>
</p>

<p>
&Ocirc; vierges, &ocirc; d&eacute;mons, &ocirc; monstres, &ocirc; martyres,<br>
De la r&eacute;alit&eacute; grands esprits contempteurs,<br>
Chercheuses d'infini, d&eacute;votes et satyres,<br>
Tant&ocirc;t pleines de cris, tant&ocirc;t pleines de pleurs,<br>
</p>

<p>
Vous que dans votre enfer mon &acirc;me a poursuivies,<br>
Pauvres soeurs, je vous aime autant que je vous plains,<br>
Pour vos mornes douleurs, vos soifs inassouvies,<br>
Et les urnes d'amour dont vos grands coeurs sont pleins<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>Damned Women</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Lying on the sand like ruminating cattle, <br>
They turn their eyes toward the horizon of the sea, <br>
And their clasped hands and their feet which seek the other's <br>
Know both sweet languor and shudders of pain.<br>
</p>

<p>
Some, whose hearts grew amorous from long confessions, <br>
In the depth of the woods, among the babbling brooks, <br>
Spell out the love of their timid adolescence <br>
By carving the green wood of young saplings;<br>
</p>

<p>
Others, like sisters, walk gravely and with slow steps <br>
Among the high rocks peopled with apparitions, <br>
Where Saint Anthony saw the naked, purple breasts <br>
Of his temptations rise up like lava;<br>
</p>

<p>
There are some who by the light of crumbling resin <br>
In the silent void of the old pagan caverns <br>
Call out for help from their screaming fevers to you <br>
O Bacchus, who lull to sleep the ancient remorse!<br>
</p>

<p>
And others, whose breasts love the feel of scapulars, <br>
Who, concealing a whip under their long habits, <br>
Mingle, in the dark woods and solitary nights, <br>
The froth of pleasure with tears of torment.<br>
</p>

<p>
O virgins, O demons, O monsters, O martyrs,<br>
Great spirits, contemptuous of reality,<br>
Seekers of the infinite, pious and satyric,<br>
Sometimes full of cries, sometimes full of tears,<br>
</p>

<p>
You whom my spirit has followed into your hell,<br>
Poor sisters, I love you as much as I pity you,<br>
For your gloomy sorrows, your unsatisfied thirsts,<br>
And the urns of love with which your great hearts are filled!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Damned Women</b>
</p>

<p>
Like pensive cattle lying on the sand <br>
They scan the far horizon of the ocean, <br>
Foot seeking foot, hand magnetising hand, <br>
With sweet or bitter tremors of emotion.<br>
</p>

<p>
Some with their hearts absorbed in confidences, <br>
Deep in the woods, where streamlets chatter free, <br>
Spell the loved names of childish, timid fancies, <br>
And carve the green wood of the fresh, young tree.<br>
</p>

<p>
Others, like sisters wander, slow and grave, <br>
Through craggy haunts of ghostly emanations, <br>
Where once Saint Anthony was wont to brave <br>
The purple-breasted pride of his temptations.<br>
</p>

<p>
Some by the light of resin-scented torches <br>
In the dumb hush of caverns seek their shrine, <br>
Invoking Bacchus, killer of remorses, <br>
To liven their delirium with wine.<br>
</p>

<p>
Others who deal with scapulars and hoods <br>
Hiding the whiplash under their long train, <br>
Mingle, on lonely nights in sombre woods, <br>
The foam of pleasure with the tears of pain.<br>
</p>

<p>
O demons, monsters, virgins, martyrs, you<br>
Who trample base reality in scorn,<br>
Whether as nuns or satyrs you pursue<br>
The infinite, with cries or tears forlorn,<br>
</p>

<p>
You, whom my soul has tracked to lairs infernal, <br>
Poor sisterhood, I pity and adore, <br>
For your despairing griefs, your thirst eternal, <br>
And love that floods your hearts for evermore!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Condemned Women</b>
</p>

<p>
Like thoughtful cattle on the yellow sands reclined, <br>
They turn their eyes towards the horizon of the sea, <br>
Their feet towards each other stretched, their hands entwined, <br>
They tell of gentle yearning, frigid misery. <br>
</p>

<p>
A few, with heart-confiding faith of old, imbued <br>
Amid the darkling grove, where silver streamlets flow, <br>
Unfold to each their loves of tender infanthood, <br>
And carve the verdant stems of the vine-kissed portico. <br>
</p>

<p>
And others like unto nuns with footsteps slow and grave, <br>
Ascend the hallowed rocks of ancient mystic lore, <br>
Where long ago &mdash; St. Anthony, like a surging wave, <br>
The naked purpled breasts of his temptation saw. <br>
</p>

<p>
And still some more, that 'neath the shimmering masses stroll, <br>
Among the silent chasm of some pagan caves, <br>
To soothe their burning fevers unto thee they call <br>
O Bacchus! who all ancient wounds and sorrow laves. <br>
</p>

<p>
And others again, whose necks in scapulars delight, <br>
Who hide a whip beneath their garments secretly, <br>
Commingling, in the sombre wood and lonesome night, <br>
The foam of torments and of tears with ecstasy. <br>
</p>

<p>
O virgins, demons, monsters, and O martyred brood! <br>
Great souls that mock Reality with remorseless sneers, <br>
O saints and satyrs, searchers for infinitude! <br>
At times so full of shouts, at times so full of tears! <br>
</p>

<p>
You, to whom within your hell my spirit flies, <br>
Poor sisters &mdash; yea, I love you as I pity you, <br>
For your unsatiated thirsts and anguished sighs, <br>
And for the vials of love within your hearts so true. <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Cyril Scott, <i>Baudelaire: The Flowers of Evil</i> (London: Elkin Mathews, 1909)
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Damned Women</b><br>
</p>

<p>
They lie like pensive cattle on the sands, <br>
And as their gaze to the far sea's edge clings, <br>
Their feet which twine, and their enclasped hands <br>
Suffer sweet swoons and bitter shudderings. <br>
</p>

<p>
But some, enamoured of long converse, stray <br>
Where the streams wander through the coppices, <br>
Spell out the loves of timid childhood's day, <br>
And carve the green wood of the little trees. <br>
</p>

<p>
Others like sisters wander slow and grave <br>
Across the rocks where phantom shapes flit dim, <br>
Where Anthony saw, surging wave on wave. <br>
The naked purple breasts which tempted him. <br>
</p>

<p>
Some there are who, by crumbling torches' light <br>
In the dumb gulfs of pagan caverns deep. <br>
Pray thee to put their fever-throes to flight, <br>
Bacchus! who drownest old remorse in sleep. <br>
</p>

<p>
And others, fain of scapularies, roam <br>
With a long whip beneath their garments' fold, <br>
And in lone woods at midnight mingle foam <br>
Of joy with cries of anguish manifold. <br>
</p>

<p>
O virgins, demons, monsters, martyrs! ye <br>
Who scorn reality through all the years; <br>
Soiled holy ones who seek infinity <br>
So full of cries and, ah! so full of tears! <br>
</p>

<p>
Poor sisters whom my soul has tracked in hell, <br>
I love you and I weep for all your woe: <br>
Your burning thirst, your pains unspeakable. <br>
The wells of love with which your hearts o'erflow. <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jack Collings Squire, <i>Poems and Baudelaire Flowers</i> (London: The New Age Press, Ltd, 1909)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Accursed</b>
</p>

<p>
Like pensive herds at rest upon the sands,<br>
These to the sea-horizons turn their eyes;<br>
Out of their folded feet and clinging hands<br>
Bitter sharp tremblings and soft languors rise.<br>
</p>

<p>
Some tread the thicket by the babbling stream,<br>
Their hearts with untold secrets ill at ease;<br>
Calling the lover of their childhood's dream,<br>
They wound the green bark of the shooting trees.<br>
</p>

<p>
Others like sisters wander, grave and slow,<br>
Among the rocks haunted by spectres thin,<br>
Where Antony saw as larvæ surge and flow<br>
The veined bare breasts that tempted him to sin.<br>
</p>

<p>
Some, when the resinous torch of burning wood<br>
Flares in lost pagan caverns dark and deep,<br>
Call thee to quench the fever in their blood,<br>
Bacchus, who singest old remorse to sleep!<br>
</p>

<p>
Then there are those the scapular bedights,<br>
Whose long white vestments hide the whip's red stain,<br>
Who mix, in sombre woods on lonely nights,<br>
The foam of pleasure with the tears of pain.<br>
</p>

<p>
O virgins, demons, monsters, martyrs! ye<br>
Who scorn whatever actual appears;<br>
Saints, satyrs, seekers of Infinity,<br>
So full of cries, so full of bitter tears;<br>
</p>

<p>
Ye whom my soul has followed into hell,<br>
I love and pity, O sad sisters mine,<br>
Your thirsts unquenched, your pains no tongue can tell,<br>
And your great hearts, those urns of love divine!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; F.P. Sturm, from <i>Baudelaire: His Prose and Poetry</i>, edited by Thomas Robert Smith (New York: Boni and Liveright, 1919)

<p>
<b>The Damned Women</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Lounging like pensive cattle on the sand, <br>
They turn their eyes to the horizon of seas, <br>
And their feet seek each other and their close hands <br>
Now languish with softness, now quiver with gall.<br>
</p>

<p>
Some, their hearts captivated by slow secrets <br>
In the depths of bushes chattering with streams, <br>
Go gathering the first loves of timid childhoods <br>
Exploring the green wood of tender trees;<br>
</p>

<p>
Others, like nuns, slow and grave, move <br>
Over rocks swarming with visions, <br>
Where St. Anthony saw rise up the lava <br>
Of the purple naked breasts of his temptations;<br>
</p>

<p>
There are some who, to the resin's shaking glimmer, <br>
Call, from the silent hollows of old pagan caverns, <br>
To you, O Bacchus, who soothe remorse, <br>
For help out of their shouting fevers.<br>
</p>

<p>
And others, whose bosoms crave the scapular, <br>
Who hide a whip under their long clothes <br>
And mingle, in the dismal wood and lonely night, <br>
The foam of pleasure with the twists of pain.<br>
</p>

<p>
To you, virgins, demons, monsters, martyrs,<br>
To your great spirits spurning reality,<br>
Searchers of the infinite, devotees and satyrs,<br>
Now full of cries, now full of tears,<br>
</p>

<p>
To you whom to your hell my soul has followed<br>
My poor sisters, I give you my love and pity,<br>
For your dark sorrows, your unslakeable thirsts,<br>
And the caskets of your love of which your hearts are full!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Geoffrey Wagner, <i>Selected Poems of Charles Baudelaire</i> (NY: Grove Press, 1974) <br>
