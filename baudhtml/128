<b>Le Vampire</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Toi qui, comme un coup de couteau,<br>
Dans mon coeur plaintif es entr&eacute;e;<br>
Toi qui, forte comme un troupeau<br>
De d&eacute;mons, vins, folle et par&eacute;e,<br>
</p>

<p>
De mon esprit humili&eacute;<br>
Faire ton lit et ton domaine;<br>
&mdash; Inf&acirc;me &agrave; qui je suis li&eacute;<br>
Comme le for&ccedil;at &agrave; la cha&icirc;ne,<br>
</p>

<p>
Comme au jeu le joueur t&ecirc;tu,<br>
Comme &agrave; la bouteille l'ivrogne,<br>
Comme aux vermines la charogne<br>
&mdash; Maudite, maudite sois-tu!<br>
</p>

<p>
J'ai pri&eacute; le glaive rapide<br>
De conqu&eacute;rir ma libert&eacute;,<br>
Et j'ai dit au poison perfide<br>
De secourir ma l&acirc;chet&eacute;.<br>
</p>

<p>
H&eacute;las! le poison et le glaive<br>
M'ont pris en d&eacute;dain et m'ont dit:<br>
&laquo;Tu n'es pas digne qu'on t'enl&egrave;ve<br>
&Agrave; ton esclavage maudit,<br>
</p>

<p>
Imb&eacute;cile! &mdash; de son empire<br>
Si nos efforts te d&eacute;livraient,<br>
Tes baisers ressusciteraient<br>
Le cadavre de ton vampire!&raquo;<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>The Vampire</b><br>
</p>

<p>
You who, like the stab of a knife,<br>
Entered my plaintive heart;<br>
You who, strong as a herd<br>
Of demons, came, ardent and adorned,<br>
</p>

<p>
To make your bed and your domain<br>
Of my humiliated mind<br>
&mdash; Infamous bitch to whom I'm bound<br>
Like the convict to his chain,<br>
</p>

<p>
Like the stubborn gambler to the game, <br>
Like the drunkard to his wine, <br>
Like the maggots to the corpse,<br>
&mdash; Accurst, accurst be you!<br>
</p>

<p>
I begged the swift poniard <br>
To gain for me my liberty, <br>
I asked perfidious poison <br>
To give aid to my cowardice.<br>
</p>

<p>
Alas! both poison and the knife<br>
Contemptuously said to me:<br>
"You do not deserve to be freed<br>
From your accursed slavery,<br>
</p>

<p>
Fool! &mdash; if from her domination<br>
Our efforts could deliver you,<br>
Your kisses would resuscitate<br>
The cadaver of your vampire!"<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>


<p>
<b>The Vampire</b>
</p>

<p>
You, who like a dagger ploughed <br>
Into my heart with deadly thrill: <br>
You who, stronger than a crowd <br>
Of demons, mad, and dressed to kill,<br>
</p>

<p>
Of my dejected soul have made<br>
Your bed, your lodging, and domain:<br>
To whom I'm linked (Unseemly jade!)<br>
As is a convict to his chain,<br>
</p>

<p>
Or as the gamester to his dice, <br>
Or as the drunkard to his dram, <br>
Or as the carrion to its lice &mdash; <br>
I curse you. Would my curse could damn!<br>
</p>

<p>
I have besought the sudden blade <br>
To win for me my freedom back. <br>
Perfidious poison I have prayed <br>
To help my cowardice. Alack!<br>
</p>

<p>
Both poison and the sword disdained<br>
My cowardice, and seemed to say<br>
"You are not fit to be unchained<br>
From your damned servitude. Away,<br>
</p>

<p>
You imbecile! since if from her empire <br>
We were to liberate the slave, <br>
You'd raise the carrion of your vampire, <br>
By your own kisses, from the grave."<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Vampire</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Thou who abruptly as a knife<br>
Didst come into my heart; thou who,<br>
A demon horde into my life,<br>
Didst enter, wildly dancing, through<br>
</p>

<p>
The doorways of my sense unlatched<br>
To make my spirit thy domain &mdash; <br>
Harlot to whom I am attached<br>
As convicts to the ball and chain,<br>
</p>

<p>
As gamblers to the wheel's bright spell, <br>
As drunkards to their raging thirst, <br>
As corpses to their worms &mdash; accurst <br>
Be thou! Oh, be thou damned to hell!<br>
</p>

<p>
I have entreated the swift sword <br>
To strike, that I at once be freed; <br>
The poisoned phial I have implored <br>
To plot with me a ruthless deed.<br>
</p>

<p>
Alas! the phial and the blade <br>
Do cry aloud and laugh at me: <br>
"Thou art not worthy of our aid; <br>
Thou art not worthy to be free.<br>
</p>

<p>
"Though one of us should be the tool<br>
To save thee from thy wretched fate,<br>
Thy kisses would resuscitate<br>
The body of thy vampire, fool!"<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; George Dillon, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Vampire</b>
</p>

<p>
Lust, like a fang in my throat,<br>
and you, gorgeous and wild, <br>
a demon embracing my soul,<br>
claiming me as yours and yours alone!<br>
</p>

<p>
And me, caught, humiliated, shackled,<br>
a stupid gambler, losing, ever losing,<br>
a drunkard, staggering from your venom,<br>
my needs like maggots on a rotten carcass!<br>
</p>

<p>
A way, any way, through stabbing or poisoning,<br>
to find release from my cowardice,<br>
but, no, these remedies, they spoke to me in flat disgust:<br>
</p>

<p>
"Get away from her?  No chance.<br>
No sooner than you'd see her dead,<br>
you'd press your mouth against her lips<br>
and resurrect your vampire's corpse!"<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Edward Eriksson
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Vampire</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Thou, sharper than a dagger thrust<br>
Sinking into my plaintive heart,<br>
Thou, frenzied and arrayed in lust,<br>
Strong as a demon host whose art<br>
</p>

<p>
Possessed my humbled soul at last,<br>
Made it thy bed and thy domain,<br>
Strumpet, to whom I am bound fast<br>
As is the convict to his chain,<br>
</p>

<p>
The stubborn gambler to his dice, <br>
The rabid drunkard to his bowl, <br>
The carcass to its vermin lice &mdash; <br>
O thrice-accurs&egrave;d be thy soul!<br>
</p>

<p>
I called on the swift sword to smite <br>
One blow to free my life of this, <br>
I begged perfidious aconite <br>
For succor in my cowardice.<br>
</p>

<p>
But sword and poison in my need<br>
Heaped scorn upon my craven mood,<br>
Saying: &quot;Unworthy to be freed,<br>
From thine accursed servitude,<br>
</p>

<p>
O fool, if through our efforts, Fate <br>
Absolved thee from thy sorry plight, <br>
Thy kisses would resuscitate <br>
Thy vampire's corpse for thy delight.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jacques LeClercq, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (Mt Vernon, NY: Peter Pauper Press, 1958)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Vampire</b>
</p>

<p>
You who, keen as a carving blade,<br>
Into my plaintive heart has plunged,<br>
You who, strong as a wild array<br>
Of crazed and costumed cacodaemons,<br>
</p>

<p>
Storming into my helpless soul<br>
To make your bed and your domain;<br>
&#151; Tainted jade to whom I'm joined<br>
Like a convict to his chain,<br>
</p>

<p>
Like a gambler to his game,<br>
Like a drunkard to his bottle,<br>
Like maggot-worms to their cadaver,<br>
Damn you, oh damn you I say!<br>
</p>

<p>
I pleaded with the speedy sword<br>
To win me back my liberty;<br>
And finally, a desperate coward,<br>
I turned to poison's perfidy.<br>
</p>

<p>
Alas, but poison and the sword<br>
Had only scorn to offer me:<br>
"You're not worthy to be free<br>
Of your wretched slavery,<br>
</p>

<p>
You imbecile! &#151; For if our means<br>
Should release you from her reign,<br>
You with your kisses would only breathe<br>
New life into the vampire slain!"<br>
</p>

Two editions of <i>Fleurs du mal</i> were published in Baudelaire's lifetime &mdash; one in 1857 and an expanded edition in 1861. "Scraps" and censored poems were collected in <i>Les &Eacute;paves</i> in 1866. After Baudelaire died the following year, a "definitive" edition appeared in 1868.
