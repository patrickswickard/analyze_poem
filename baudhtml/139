<b>R&eacute;versibilit&eacute;</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Ange plein de gaiet&eacute;, connaissez-vous l'angoisse,<br>
La honte, les remords, les sanglots, les ennuis,<br>
Et les vagues terreurs de ces affreuses nuits<br>
Qui compriment le coeur comme un papier qu'on froisse?<br>
Ange plein de gaiet&eacute;, connaissez-vous l'angoisse?<br>
</p>

<p>
Ange plein de bont&eacute;, connaissez-vous la haine,<br>
Les poings crisp&eacute;s dans l'ombre et les larmes de fiel,<br>
Quand la Vengeance bat son infernal rappel,<br>
Et de nos facult&eacute;s se fait le capitaine?<br>
Ange plein de bont&eacute; connaissez-vous la haine?<br>
</p>

<p>
Ange plein de sant&eacute;, connaissez-vous les Fi&egrave;vres,<br>
Qui, le long des grands murs de l'hospice blafard,<br>
Comme des exil&eacute;s, s'en vont d'un pied tra&icirc;nard,<br>
Cherchant le soleil rare et remuant les l&egrave;vres?<br>
Ange plein de sant&eacute;, connaissez-vous les Fi&egrave;vres?<br>
</p>

<p>
Ange plein de beaut&eacute;, connaissez-vous les rides,<br>
Et la peur de vieillir, et ce hideux tourment<br>
De lire la secr&egrave;te horreur du d&eacute;vouement<br>
Dans des yeux o&ugrave; longtemps burent nos yeux avide!<br>
Ange plein de beaut&eacute;, connaissez-vous les rides?<br>
</p>

<p>
Ange plein de bonheur, de joie et de lumi&egrave;res,<br>
David mourant aurait demand&eacute; la sant&eacute;<br>
Aux &eacute;manations de ton corps enchant&eacute;;<br>
Mais de toi je n'implore, ange, que tes pri&egrave;res,<br>
Ange plein de bonheur, de joie et de lumi&egrave;res!<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>Reversibility</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Angel full of gaiety, do you know anguish, <br>
Shame, remorse, sobs, vexations, <br>
And the vague terrors of those frightful nights <br>
That compress the heart like a paper one crumples? <br>
Angel full of gaiety, do you know anguish?<br>
</p>

<p>
Angel full of kindness, do you know hatred, <br>
The clenched fists in the darkness and the tears of gall, <br>
When Vengeance beats out his hellish call to arms, <br>
And makes himself the captain of our faculties? <br>
Angel full of kindness, do you know hatred?<br>
</p>

<p>
Angel full of health, do you know Fever, <br>
Walking like an exile, moving with dragging steps, <br>
Along the high, wan walls of the charity ward, <br>
And with muttering lips seeking the rare sunlight? <br>
Angel full of health, do you know Fever?<br>
</p>

<p>
Angel full of beauty, do you know wrinkles, <br>
The fear of growing old, and the hideous torment <br>
Of reading in the eyes of her he once adored <br>
Horror at seeing love turning to devotion? <br>
Angel full of beauty, do you know wrinkles?<br>
</p>

<p>
Angel full of happiness, of joy and of light,<br>
David on his death-bed would have appealed for health<br>
To the emanations of your enchanted flesh;<br>
But of you, angel, I beg only prayers,<br>
Angel full of happiness, of joy and of light!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>

<b>Reversibility</b>
</p>

<p>
Angel of gaiety, have you known anguish, <br>
Shame and remorse, tears, boredom, and dismay, <br>
Vague horrors of the nights in which we languish, <br>
Which crumple hearts like papers thrown away? <br>
Angel of gaiety, have you known anguish?<br>
</p>

<p>
Angel of kindness, have you met with hate? <br>
Fists clenched in gloom, eyes running tears of gall, <br>
When Vengeance beats his drum to subjugate <br>
Our faculties, the captain of them all? <br>
Angel of kindness, have you met with hate?<br>
</p>

<p>
Angel of health, have you beheld the Fevers? <br>
Across pale walls of wards they limp and stumble, <br>
Like exiles wan, with agues, chills, and shivers, <br>
Seeking the scanty sun with lips that mumble. <br>
Angel of health, have you beheld the Fevers?<br>
</p>

<p>
Angel of beauty, do you know Old Age, <br>
The fear of wrinkles, and the dire emotion, <br>
In eyes we've pierced too long, as on a page, <br>
To read the secret horror of devotion? <br>
Angel of beauty do you know Old Age?<br>
</p>

<p>
Angel of goodness, radiance, and delight, <br>
The dying David would have begged to share <br>
The emanations of your body bright. <br>
But all I wish to ask of you is prayer, <br>
Angel of goodness, radiance, and delight.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>

<b>The Angelic One</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Spirit of happiness, hast thou heard tell of woe? <br>
Hast thou heard tell of anguish, and remorse, and care &mdash; <br>
Of those long nights when in the black fist of Despair <br>
The heart is crumpled up like paper? Dost thou know, <br>
Spirit of happiness? Hast thou heard tell of woe?<br>
</p>

<p>
Spirit of kindliness, hast thou heard tell of hate, <br>
The clenched hands in the darkness, the silent bitter tears, <br>
With Vengeance beating in the arteries of our ears <br>
Its dogged tom-tom, irresistible as fate? <br>
Spirit of kindliness, hast thou heard tell of hate?<br>
</p>

<p>
Spirit of health, hast thou heard whisper of Disease, <br>
Whose pallid children, in the courtyard gray with soot <br>
Of the bleak hospital, go dragging a slow foot <br>
To find a patch of sunlight? Host thou heard of these? <br>
Spirit of health, hast thou heard whisper of Disease?<br>
</p>

<p>
Spirit of beauty, hast thou heard of ugliness, <br>
Of the long secret torment of growing old &mdash; above <br>
All else, the pain of reading in the eyes we love <br>
A wordless horror, even while the lips say "yes?" <br>
Spirit of beauty, hast thou heard of ugliness?<br>
</p>

<p>
Spirit of joy, spirit of beauty, spirit of light, <br>
David, grown old, would have thought nothing to implore <br>
Thy healing touch, thy warm young presence in the night; <br>
But, spirit, I only ask of thee thy prayers, no more &mdash; <br>
Spirit of joy, spirit of beauty, spirit of light!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; George Dillon, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>

<b>Reversibility</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Angel, teeming with gaiety, do you know grief,<br>
Anguish, remorse and shame, their ravages and blights,<br>
And the vague terrors of those panic-stricken nights<br>
Which squeeze the heartstrings dry as a sere crumpled leaf?<br>
Angel, teeming with gaiety, do you know grief?<br>
</p>

<p>
Angel, teeming with kindliness, do you know hate, <br>
Fists tight-clenched in the shadows, scalding tears of gall, <br>
When Vengeance roars with his infernal battle-call, <br>
Making himself the captain of our acts and fate? <br>
Angel, teeming with kindliness, do you know hate?<br>
</p>

<p>
Angel, teeming with healthfulness, do you know Fever <br>
Who like an exile lopes with dragging step towards <br>
The wan stark walls of hospitals and public wards, <br>
Mumbling, seeking rare sunlight for a brace or lever? <br>
Angel, teeming with healthfulness, do you know Fever?<br>
</p>

<p>
Angel, teeming with loveliness, do you know wrinkles, <br>
The fear of growing old, and, like a poisoned potion, <br>
The dread of seeing love turn into fond devotion <br>
In eyes adored, once blue and pure as periwinkles? <br>
Angel, teeming with loveliness, do you know wrinkles?<br>
</p>

<p>
Angel, teeming with happy, blithe, luminous airs, <br>
David upon his deathbed would have craved for power <br>
From the suave emanations of your body's flower, <br>
But I, angel, beseech of you only your prayers, <br>
Angel, teeming with happy, blithe, luminous airs!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jacques LeClercq, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (Mt Vernon, NY: Peter Pauper Press, 1958)<br>

<b>Reversibility</b>
</p>

<p>
Angel of gaiety, have you tasted grief?<br>
Shame and remorse and sobs and weary spite,<br>
And the vague terrors of the fearful night<br>
That crush the heart up like a crumpled leaf?<br>
Angel of gaiety, have you tasted grief?<br>
</p>

<p>
Angel of kindness, have you tasted hate?<br>
With hands clenched in the shade and tears of gall,<br>
When Vengeance beats her hellish battle-call,<br>
And makes herself the captain of our fate,<br>
Angel of kindness, have you tasted hate?<br>
</p>

<p>
Angel of health, did ever you know pain,<br>
Which like an exile trails his tired footfalls<br>
The cold length of the white infirmary walls,<br>
With lips compressed, seeking the sun in vain?<br>
Angel of health, did ever you know pain?<br>
</p>

<p>
Angel of beauty, do you wrinkles know?<br>
Know you the fear of age, the torment vile<br>
Of reading secret horror in the smile<br>
Of eyes your eyes have loved since long ago?<br>
Angel of beauty, do you crinkles know?<br>
</p>

<p>
Angel of happiness, and joy, and light,<br>
Old David would have asked for youth afresh<br>
From the pure touch of your enchanted flesh;<br>
I but implore your prayers to aid my plight,<br>
Angel of happiness, and joy, and light.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; F.P. Sturm, from <i>Baudelaire: His Prose and Poetry</i>, edited by Thomas Robert Smith (New York: Boni and Liveright, 1919)

Two editions of <i>Fleurs du mal</i> were published in Baudelaire's lifetime &mdash; one in 1857 and an expanded edition in 1861. "Scraps" and censored poems were collected in <i>Les &Eacute;paves</i> in 1866. After Baudelaire died the following year, a "definitive" edition appeared in 1868.
