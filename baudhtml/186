<b>Les M&eacute;tamorphoses du vampire</b><br>
</p>

<p>
La femme cependant, de sa bouche de fraise,<br>
En se tordant ainsi qu'un serpent sur la braise, <br>
Et p&eacute;trissant ses seins sur le fer de son busc, <br>
Laissait couler ces mots tout impr&eacute;gn&eacute;s de musc: <br>
&mdash; &laquo;Moi, j'ai la l&egrave;vre humide, et je sais la science <br>
De perdre au fond d'un lit l'antique conscience. <br>
Je s&egrave;che tous les pleurs sur mes seins triomphants, <br>
Et fais rire les vieux du rire des enfants. <br>
Je remplace, pour qui me voit nue et sans voiles, <br>
La lune, le soleil, le ciel et les &eacute;toiles! <br>
Je suis, mon cher savant, si docte aux volupt&eacute;s, <br>
Lorsque j'&eacute;touffe un homme en mes bras redout&eacute;s, <br>
Ou lorsque j'abandonne aux morsures mon buste, <br>
Timide et libertine, et fragile et robuste, <br>
Que sur ces matelas qui se p&acirc;ment d'&eacute;moi, <br>
Les anges impuissants se damneraient pour moi!&raquo; <br>
</p>

<p>
Quand elle eut de mes os suc&eacute; toute la moelle, <br>
Et que languissamment je me tournai vers elle <br>
Pour lui rendre un baiser d'amour, je ne vis plus <br>
Qu'une outre aux flancs gluants, toute pleine de pus! <br>
Je fermai les deux yeux, dans ma froide &eacute;pouvante, <br>
Et quand je les rouvris &agrave; la clart&eacute; vivante, <br>
&Agrave; mes c&ocirc;t&eacute;s, au lieu du mannequin puissant <br>
Qui semblait avoir fait provision de sang, <br>
Tremblaient confus&eacute;ment des d&eacute;bris de squelette, <br>
Qui d'eux-m&ecirc;mes rendaient le cri d'une girouette <br>
Ou d'une enseigne, au bout d'une tringle de fer, <br>
Que balance le vent pendant les nuits d'hiver.

<b>The Vampire's Metamorphoses</b><br>
</p>

<p>
The woman meanwhile, twisting like a snake <br>
On hot coals and kneading her breasts against the steel <br>
Of her corset, from her mouth red as strawberries <br>
Let flow these words impregnated with musk:<br>
&mdash; "I, I have moist lips, and I know the art <br>
Of losing old Conscience in the depths of a bed. <br>
I dry all tears on my triumphant breasts <br>
And make old men laugh with the laughter of children. <br>
I replace, for him who sees me nude, without veils, <br>
The moon, the sun, the stars and the heavens! <br>
I am, my dear scholar, so learned in pleasure <br>
That when I smother a man in my fearful arms, <br>
Or when, timid and licentious, frail and robust, <br>
I yield my bosom to biting kisses <br>
On those two soft cushions which swoon with emotion, <br>
The powerless angels would damn themselves for me!"<br>
</p>

<p>
When she had sucked out all the marrow from my bones <br>
And I languidly turned toward her <br>
To give back an amorous kiss, I saw no more <br>
Than a wine-skin with gluey sides, all full of pus! <br>
Frozen with terror, I closed both my eyes, <br>
And when I opened them to the bright light, <br>
At my side, instead of the robust manikin <br>
Who seemed to have laid in a store of blood, <br>
There quivered confusedly a heap of old bones, <br>
Which of themselves gave forth the cry of a weather-cock <br>
Or of a sign on the end of an iron rod <br>
That the wind swings to and fro on a winter night.<br>
</p>

</p>

<p>
The crimson-fruited mouth that I desired &mdash; <br>
While, like a snake on coals, she twinged and twired, <br>
Kneading her breasts against her creaking busk &mdash; <br>
Let fall those words impregnated with musk, <br>
&mdash; "My lips are humid: by my learned science, <br>
All conscience, in my bed, becomes compliance. <br>
My breasts, triumphant, staunch all tears; for me <br>
Old men, like little children, laugh with glee. <br>
For those who see me naked, I replace <br>
Sun, moon, the sky, and all the stars in space. <br>
I am so skilled, dear sage, in arts of pleasure, <br>
That, when with man my deadly arms I measure, <br>
Or to his teeth and kisses yield my bust, <br>
Timid yet lustful, fragile, yet robust, <br>
On sheets that swoon with passion &mdash; you might see <br>
Impotent angels damn themselves for me."<br>
</p>

<p>
When of my marrow she had sucked each bone <br>
And, languishing, I turned with loving moan <br>
To kiss her in return, with overplus,<br>
She seemed a swollen wineskin, full of pus. <br>
I shut my eyes with horror at the sight, <br>
But when I opened them, in the clear light, <br>
I saw, instead of the great swollen doll <br>
That, bloated with my lifeblood, used to loll, <br>
The debris of a skeleton, assembling <br>
With shrill squawks of a weathercock, lie trembling, <br>
Or sounds, with which the howling winds commingle, <br>
Of an old Inn-sign on a rusty tringle.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>

<p>
Meanwhile from her red mouth the woman, in husky tones,<br>
Twisting her body like a serpent upon hot stones<br>
And straining her white breasts from their imprisonment,<br>
Let fall these words, as potent as a heavy scent:<br>
"My lips are moist and yielding, and I know the way<br>
To keep the antique demon of remorse at bay.<br>
All sorrows die upon my bosom. I can make<br>
Old men laugh happily as children for my sake.<br>
For him who sees me naked in my tresses, I<br>
Replace the sun, the moon, and all the stars of the sky!<br>
Believe me, learn&egrave;d sir, I am so deeply skilled<br>
That when I wind a lover in my soft arms, and yield<br>
My breasts like two ripe fruits for his devouring &mdash; both<br>
Shy and voluptuous, insatiable and loath &mdash; <br>
Upon this bed that groans and sighs luxuriously<br>
Even the impotent angels would be damned for me!"<br>
</p>

<p>
When she had drained me of my very marrow, and cold <br>
And weak, I turned to give her one more kiss &mdash; behold, <br>
There at my side was nothing but a hideous <br>
Putrescent thing, all faceless and exuding pus.<br>
I closed my eyes and mercifully swooned till day: <br>
And when I looked at morning for that beast of prey <br>
Who seemed to have replenished her arteries from my own, <br>
The wan, disjointed fragments of a skeleton <br>
Wagged up and down in a lewd posture where she had lain, <br>
Rattling with each convulsion like a weathervane <br>
Or an old sign that creaks upon its bracket, right <br>
Mournfully in the wind upon a winter's night.<br>
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the woman, writhing like a snake <br>
On fiery coals, kneaded her breasts to make <br>
Them hug their steely corset; and she said, <br>
Her lips redder than strawberries are red:<br>
</p>

<p>
&quot;Behold, my mouth is moist, and on my deep<br>
Couch I can lull grim Conscience fast asleep,<br>
I dry all tears on my triumphant breasts,<br>
Where old men laugh like boys at boyish jests.<br>
For him who sees me naked, I comprise<br>
All moons and suns and stars and clouds and skies!<br>
I am so skilled, fond scholar, in love's charms<br>
That when I hug you in my ruthless arms,<br>
Or, shy and lustful, frail and forceful, when<br>
I yield taut nipples to the teeth of men,<br>
My bosom's pillows, palpitant, would doom<br>
Angels to ruin for coveting my womb...&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>
When she had sucked my marrow dry, I turned,<br>
Languid, to give her back the kiss she earned,<br>
Only to view, I fond and amorous,<br>
A viscid wineskin, nidorous with pus...<br>
</p>

<p>
Frozen with fear, I shut my eyelids tight, <br>
Then, opening them against the garish light, <br>
I saw no solid puppet by my side <br>
Whose lusts my blood, drained dry, had satisfied, <br>
But a debris of quavering bone on bone, <br>
Moaning as only weathervanes can moan, <br>
And creaking as a rusty signpost might <br>
Lashed by the furies of a winter night.<br>
</p>

<p>
Then the woman with the strawberry mouth,<br>
Squirming like a snake upon the coals,<br>
Kneading her breasts against the iron of her corset,<br>
Let flow these words scented with musk:<br>
 &mdash; "I have wet lips, and I know the art<br>
Of losing old conscience in the depths of a bed.<br>
I dry all tears on my triumphing breasts<br>
And I make old men laugh with the laughter of children.<br>
For those who see me naked, without any covering,<br>
I am the moon and the sun and the sky and the stars!<br>
I am so dexterous in voluptuous love, my dear, my wise one,<br>
When I strangle a man in my dreadful arms,<br>
Or abandon my breast to his biting,<br>
So shy and lascivious, so frail and vigorous,<br>
That on these cushions that swoon with passion<br>
The powerless angels damn their souls for me!"<br>
</p>

<p>
When she had sucked the pith from my bones <br>
And, drooping, I turned towards her <br>
To give her the kiss of love, I saw only <br>
An old leather bottle with sticky sides and full of pus! <br>
I shut both eyes in cold dismay <br>
And when I opened them both to clear reality, <br>
By my side, instead of that powerful puppet <br>
Which seemed to have taken some lease of blood, <br>
There shook vaguely the remains of a skeleton, <br>
Which itself gave the cry of a weathercock <br>
Or of a sign-board, at the end of a rod of iron, <br>
Which the wind swings in winter nights.<br>
</p>

Two editions of <i>Fleurs du mal</i> were published in Baudelaire's lifetime &mdash; one in 1857 and an expanded edition in 1861. "Scraps" and censored poems were collected in <i>Les &Eacute;paves</i> in 1866. After Baudelaire died the following year, a "definitive" edition appeared in 1868.
