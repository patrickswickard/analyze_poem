<b>La Cloche f&ecirc;l&eacute;e</b><br>
</p>

<p>
II est amer et doux, pendant les nuits d'hiver,<br>
D'&eacute;couter, pr&egrave;s du feu qui palpite et qui fume,<br>
Les souvenirs lointains lentement s'&eacute;lever<br>
Au bruit des carillons qui chantent dans la brume.<br>
</p>

<p>
Bienheureuse la cloche au gosier vigoureux<br>
Qui, malgr&eacute; sa vieillesse, alerte et bien portante,<br>
Jette fid&egrave;lement son cri religieux,<br>
Ainsi qu'un vieux soldat qui veille sous la tente!<br>
</p>

<p>
Moi, mon &acirc;me est f&ecirc;l&eacute;e, et lorsqu'en ses ennuis<br>
Elle veut de ses chants peupler l'air froid des nuits,<br>
II arrive souvent que sa voix affaiblie<br>
</p>

<p>
Semble le r&acirc;le &eacute;pais d'un bless&eacute; qu'on oublie<br>
Au bord d'un lac de sang, sous un grand tas de morts<br>
Et qui meurt, sans bouger, dans d'immenses efforts.<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>The Flawed Bell</b><br>
</p>

<p>
It is bitter and sweet on winter nights <br>
To listen by the fire that smokes and palpitates, <br>
To distant souvenirs that rise up slowly <br>
At the sound of the chimes that sing in the fog.<br>
</p>

<p>
Happy is the bell which in spite of age<br>
Is vigilant and healthy, and with lusty throat<br>
Faithfully sounds its religious call,<br>
Like an old soldier watching from his tent!<br>
</p>

<p>
I, my soul is flawed, and when, a prey to ennui,<br>
She wishes to fill the cold night air with her songs,<br>
It often happens that her weakened voice<br>
</p>

<p>
Resembles the death rattle of a wounded man, <br>
Forgotten beneath a heap of dead, by a lake of blood, <br>
Who dies without moving, striving desperately.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Cracked Bell</b>
</p>

<p>
It's sweet and bitter, of a winter night, <br>
To hear, beside the crackling, smoking log, <br>
Far memories prepare themselves for flight <br>
To carillons that sound amid the fog.<br>
</p>

<p>
Happy's the bell whose vigorous throat on high, <br>
in spite of time, is sound and still unspent, <br>
To hurl his faithful and religious cry <br>
Like an old soldier watching in his tent.<br>
</p>

<p>
My soul is cracked, and when amidst its care <br>
It tries with song to fill the frosty air, <br>
Sometimes, its voice seems like the feeble croak<br>
</p>

<p>
A wounded soldier makes, lost in the smoke, <br>
Beneath a pile of dead, in bloody mire, <br>
Trying, with fearful efforts, to expire.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>


<p>
<b>The Cracked Bell</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Bitter and sweet it is on these long winter nights <br>
To sit before the fire and watch the smoking log <br>
Beat like a heart; and hear our lost, our mute delights <br>
Call with the carillons that ring out in the fog.<br>
</p>

<p>
What certitude, what health, sounds from that brazen throat, <br>
In spite of age and rust, alert! O happy bell, <br>
Sending into the dark your clear religious note, <br>
Like an old soldier crying through the night, "All's well!"<br>
</p>

<p>
I am not thus; my soul is cracked across by care;<br>
Its voice, that once could clang upon this icy air,<br>
Has lost the power, it seems, &mdash; comes faintly forth, instead,<br>
</p>

<p>
As from the rattling throat of a hurt man who lies <br>
Beside a lake of blood, under a heap of dead, <br>
And cannot stir, and in prodigious struggling dies.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Edna St. Vincent Millay, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Flawed Bell</b>
</p>

<p>
Bitter and sweet it is, in winter night,<br>
Hard by the flickering fire that smokes, to list<br>
While far-off memories rise in sad slow flight,<br>
With chimes that echo singing through the mist.<br>
</p>

<p>
O blessÃ«d be the bell whose vigorous throat,<br>
In spite of age alert, with strength unspent,<br>
Utters religiously his faithful note,<br>
Like an old warrior watching near the tent!<br>
</p>

<p>
My soul, alas! is flawed, and when despair<br>
Would people with her songs the chill night-air<br>
Too oft they faint in hoarse enfeebled tones,<br>
</p>

<p>
As when a wounded man forgotten moans<br>
By the red pool, beneath a heap of dead,<br>
And dying writhes in frenzy on his bed.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; W. J. Robertson, from <i>Baudelaire: His Prose and Poetry</i>, edited by Thomas Robert Smith (New York: Boni and Liveright, 1919)
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Broken Bell</b>
</p>

<p>
How sweet and bitter, on a winter night, <br>
Beside the palpitating fire to list, <br>
As, slowly, distant memories alight, <br>
To sounds of chimes that sing across the mist. <br>
</p>

<p>
Oh, happy is that bell with hearty throat, <br>
Which neither age nor time can e'er defeat, <br>
Which faithfully uplifts its pious note, <br>
Like an ag&egrave;d soldier on his beat. <br>
</p>

<p>
For me, my soul is cracked, and 'mid her cares, <br>
Would often fill with her songs the midnight airs;<br>
And oft it chances that her feeble moan <br>
</p>

<p>
Is like the wounded warrior's fainting groan, <br>
Who by a lake of blood, 'neath bodies slain, <br>
In anguish falls, and never moves again. <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Cyril Scott, <i>Baudelaire: The Flowers of Evil</i> (London: Elkin Mathews, 1909)
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>La Cloche f&ecirc;l&eacute;e</b><br>
</p>

<p>
'tis bitter joy, as winter evenings wear<br>
before a smoking hearth which flames aghast,<br>
to hear slow memories mounting from the past,<br>
while church-bells pierce the pall of misty air.<br>
</p>

<p>
bless&egrave;d the flawless bell, of metal rare,<br>
the full-toned bourdon, void of rift and rust,<br>
which like a guardsman faithful to his trust<br>
hurls forth unfailingly its call to prayer!<br>
</p>

<p>
my soul's a riven bell, that timidly<br>
would fill the frozen night with melody,<br>
but oft it falters, whisperingly weak<br>
</p>

<p>
as, echoing over lakes of blood, a shriek<br>
muffled by mounds of dead, from one who lies<br>
moveless as they, though struggling till he dies.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Lewis Piaget Shanks, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (New York: Ives Washburn, 1931)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Cracked Bell</b><br>
</p>

<p>
'Tis bitter-sweet, when winter nights are long, <br>
To watch, beside the flames which smoke and twist, <br>
The distant memories which slowly throng, <br>
Brought by the chime soft-singing through the mist. <br>
</p>

<p>
Happy the sturdy, vigorous-throated bell <br>
Who, spite of age alert and confident, <br>
Cries hourly, like some strong old sentinel <br>
Flinging the ready challenge from his tent. <br>
</p>

<p>
For me, my soul is cracked; when, sick with care, <br>
She strives with songs to people the cold air <br>
It happens often that her feeble cries <br>
</p>

<p>
Mock the harsh rattle of a man who lies <br>
Wounded, forgotten, 'neath a mound of slain <br>
And dies, pinned fast, writhing his limbs in vain. <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jack Collings Squire, <i>Poems and Baudelaire Flowers</i> (London: The New Age Press, Ltd, 1909)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Cracked Bell</b><br>
</p>

<p>
It is bitter and sweet, during winter nights,<br>
To listen, beside the throbbing, smoking fire, <br>
To distant memories slowly ascending <br>
In the sound of the chimes chanting through the fog.<br>
</p>

<p>
Blessed the bell with the vigorous gullet<br>
Which, despite old age, watchful and healthy,<br>
Throws out faithfully its pious tones,<br>
Like an old soldier in vigil under his tent!<br>
</p>

<p>
Ah, my soul is cracked, and when in sorrows<br>
It wishes to people the cold air of the night with its songs,<br>
Often it happens that its feeble voice<br>
</p>

<p>
Seems like the thick death-rattle of one wounded, forgotten <br>
By the side of a lake of blood, under a great weight of dead, <br>
Who dies, without moving, amongst enormous efforts.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Geoffrey Wagner, <i>Selected Poems of Charles Baudelaire</i> (NY: Grove Press, 1974) <br>
