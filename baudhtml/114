<b>Don Juan aux enfers</b><br>
</p>

</p>
<p>
Quand Don Juan descendit vers l'onde souterraine<br>
Et lorsqu'il eut donn&eacute; son obole &agrave; Charon,<br>
Un sombre mendiant, l'oeil fier comme Antisth&egrave;ne,<br>
D'un bras vengeur et fort saisit chaque aviron.<br>
</p>

<p>
Montrant leurs seins pendants et leurs robes ouvertes,<br>
Des femmes se tordaient sous le noir firmament,<br>
Et, comme un grand troupeau de victimes offertes,<br>
Derri&egrave;re lui tra&icirc;naient un long mugissement.<br>
</p>

<p>
Sganarelle en riant lui r&eacute;clamait ses gages,<br>
Tandis que Don Luis avec un doigt tremblant<br>
Montrait &agrave; tous les morts errant sur les rivages<br>
Le fils audacieux qui railla son front blanc.<br>
</p>

<p>
Frissonnant sous son deuil, la chaste et maigre Elvire,<br>
Pr&egrave;s de l'&eacute;poux perfide et qui fut son amant,<br>
Semblait lui r&eacute;clamer un supr&ecirc;me sourire<br>
O&ugrave; brill&acirc;t la douceur de son premier serment.<br>
</p>

<p>
Tout droit dans son armure, un grand homme de pierre<br>
Se tenait &agrave; la barre et coupait le flot noir;<br>
Mais le calme h&eacute;ros, courb&eacute; sur sa rapi&egrave;re,<br>
Regardait le sillage et ne daignait rien voir.<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>Don Juan in Hades</b><br>
</p>

<p>
When Don Juan descended to the underground sea, <br>
And when he had given his obolus to Charon, <br>
That gloomy mendicant, with Antisthenes' proud look, <br>
Seized the two oars with strong, revengeful hands.<br>
</p>

<p>
Showing their pendent breasts and their unfastened gowns <br>
Women writhed and twisted under the black heavens, <br>
And like a great flock of sacrificial victims, <br>
A continuous groan trailed along in the wake.<br>
</p>

<p>
Sganarelle with a laugh was demanding his wage, <br>
While Don Luis with a trembling finger <br>
Was showing to the dead, wandering along the shores, <br>
The impudent son who had mocked his white brow.<br>
</p>

<p>
Shuddering in her grief, Elvira, chaste and thin, <br>
Near her treacherous spouse who was once her lover, <br>
Seemed to implore of him a final, parting smile <br>
That would shine with the sweetness of his first promises.<br>
</p>

<p>
Erect in his armor, a tall man carved from stone <br>
Was standing at the helm and cutting the black flood; <br>
But the hero unmoved, leaning on his rapier, <br>
Kept gazing at the wake and deigned not look aside.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Don Juan in Hell</b>
</p>

<p>
When, having reached the subterranean wave, <br>
Don Juan paid his passage from the shore, <br>
Proud as Antisthenes, a surly knave <br>
With vengeful arms laid hold of either oar.<br>
</p>

<p>
With hanging breasts between their mantles showing <br>
Sad women, writhing under the black sky, <br>
Made, as they went, the sound of cattle lowing <br>
As from a votive herd that's led to die.<br>
</p>

<p>
Sganarelle for his wages seemed to linger, <br>
And laughed; while to the dead assembled there, <br>
Don Luis pointed out with trembling finger <br>
The son who dared to flout his silver hair.<br>
</p>

<p>
Chilled in her crepe, the chaste and thin Elvira, <br>
Standing up close to her perfidious spouse, <br>
Seemed to be pleading from her old admirer <br>
For that which thrilled his first, unbroken vows.<br>
</p>

<p>
A great stone man in armour leaped aboard; <br>
Seizing the helm, the coal-black wave he cleft. <br>
But the calm hero, leaning on his sword, <br>
Had eyes for nothing but the wake they left.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>


<p>
<b>Don Juan in Hades</b><br>
</p>

<p>
He found the wide bark rocking in the Stygian breeze <br>
And came aboard, having first paid Charon what he owed. <br>
A beggar, somber and haughty as Antisthenes, <br>
Seized the long oars with a revengeful gesture and rowed.<br>
</p>

<p>
Writhing and tearing open their garments while he crossed, <br>
A crowd of disappointed females, herded there <br>
Along the bank like victims for a holocaust, <br>
Filled with a soft and bestial moaning the dark air.<br>
</p>

<p>
Sganarelle laughed triumphantly, demanding his wage; <br>
Don Luis, still wrathful, pointed with a palsied hand <br>
To the unruly son who mocked him in his old age, <br>
Calling to witness the dead throngs upon that strand.<br>
</p>

<p>
She whom he wed in church and loved a little while, <br>
Elvira, thin and trembling in her black robes of grief, <br>
Seemed to implore of her betrayer a last smile <br>
In memory of his first ardor, noble and brief.<br>
</p>

<p>
The knight he murdered and whose ghost he had rebuked <br>
Stood now, a tall and cuirassed helmsman, at the stem; <br>
But the calm hero, leaning upon his rapier, looked <br>
Absently into the water, ignoring all of them.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; George Dillon, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Don Juan In Hell</b>
</p>

<p>
The night Don Juan came to pay his fees<br>
To Charon, by the caverned water's shore,<br>
A Beggar, proud-eyed as Antisthenes,<br>
Stretched out his knotted fingers on the oar.<br>
</p>

<p>
Mournful, with drooping breasts and robes unsewn<br>
The shapes of women swayed in ebon skies,<br>
Trailing behind him with a restless moan<br>
Like cattle herded for a sacrifice.<br>
</p>

<p>
Here, grinning for his wage, stood Sganarelle,<br>
And here Don Luis pointed, bent and dim,<br>
To show the dead who lined the holes of Hell,<br>
This was that impious son who mocked at him.<br>
</p>

<p>
The hollow-eyed, the chaste Elvira came,<br>
Trembling and veiled, to view her traitor spouse.<br>
Was it one last bright smile she thought to claim,<br>
Such as made sweet the morning of his vows?<br>
</p>

<p>
A great stone man rose like a tower on board,<br>
Stood at the helm and cleft the flood profound:<br>
But the calm hero, leaning on his sword,<br>
Gazed back, and would not offer one look round.<br>
</p>


<p>
&mdash; James Elroy Flecker, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: New Directions, 1955)
</p>

<br>


<p>
<b>Don Juan in Hades</b><br>
</p>

<p>
When the hidalgo reached the subterranean seas,<br>
And, with an obol, paid Charon's accustomed score,<br>
A gloomy beggarman, proud as Antisthenes,<br>
With strong revengeful hands seized either trailing oar.<br>
</p>

<p>
With sagging breasts and gray unfastened gowns, a crowd<br>
Of women writhed in woe under a leaden sky,<br>
In their grim wake a groan trailed, mournfully and loud,<br>
Like flocks of sacrificial victims trudging by.<br>
</p>

<p>
Sganarelle, grinning, claimed his wages; dour and lank,<br>
Don Luis, with trembling finger, pointed at the prow,<br>
To show the phantoms wandering on the river bank<br>
That impious son who mocked his father's snow-white brow.<br>
</p>

<p>
Elvira, chaste and gaunt, shuddered in sorrow, while<br>
Beside her traitorous spouse (her lover, once) she seemed<br>
To crave the favor of an ultimate bright smile,<br>
Sweet as his first-made vows and as the dream she dreamed.<br>
</p>

<p>
Erect in coat-of-mail, a tall man, hewn of stone,<br>
Stood at the helm, cleaving the flood. But in mute pride,<br>
Leaning upon his sword, impassive and alone,<br>
The hero watched the wave nor deigned to look aside.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jacques LeClercq, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (Mt Vernon, NY: Peter Pauper Press, 1958)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Don Juan in Hades</b>
</p>

<p>
When Juan sought the subterranean flood,<br>
And paid his obolus on the Stygian shore,<br>
Charon, the proud and sombre beggar, stood<br>
With one strong, vengeful hand on either oar.<br>
</p>

<p>
With open robes and bodies agonised,<br>
Lost women writhed beneath that darkling sky;<br>
There were sounds as of victims sacrificed:<br>
Behind him all the dark was one long cry.<br>
</p>

<p>
And Sganarelle, with laughter, claimed his pledge;<br>
Don Luis, with trembling finger in the air,<br>
Showed to the souls who wandered in the sedge<br>
The evil son who scorned his hoary hair.<br>
</p>

<p>
Shivering with woe, chaste Elvira the while,<br>
Near him untrue to all but her till now,<br>
Seemed to beseech him for one farewell smile<br>
Lit with the sweetness of the first soft vow.<br>
</p>

<p>
And clad in armour, a tall man of stone<br>
Held firm the helm, and clove the gloomy flood;<br>
But, staring at the vessel's track alone,<br>
Bent on his sword the unmoved hero stood.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; F.P. Sturm, from <i>Baudelaire: His Prose and Poetry</i>, edited by Thomas Robert Smith (New York: Boni and Liveright, 1919)
