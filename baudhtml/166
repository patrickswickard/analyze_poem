<b>Le Cr&eacute;puscule du soir</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Voici le soir charmant, ami du criminel;<br>
II vient comme un complice, &agrave; pas de loup; le ciel<br>
Se ferme lentement comme une grande alc&ocirc;ve,<br>
Et l'homme impatient se change en b&ecirc;te fauve.<br>
</p>

<p>
&Ocirc; soir, aimable soir, d&eacute;sir&eacute; par celui<br>
Dont les bras, sans mentir, peuvent dire: Aujourd'hui<br>
Nous avons travaill&eacute;! &mdash; C'est le soir qui soulage<br>
Les esprits que d&eacute;vore une douleur sauvage,<br>
Le savant obstin&eacute; dont le front s'alourdit,<br>
Et l'ouvrier courb&eacute; qui regagne son lit.<br>
Cependant des d&eacute;mons malsains dans l'atmosph&egrave;re<br>
S'&eacute;veillent lourdement, comme des gens d'affaire,<br>
Et cognent en volant les volets et l'auvent.<br>
&Agrave; travers les lueurs que tourmente le vent<br>
La Prostitution s'allume dans les rues;<br>
Comme une fourmili&egrave;re elle ouvre ses issues;<br>
Partout elle se fraye un occulte chemin,<br>
Ainsi que l'ennemi qui tente un coup de main;<br>
Elle remue au sein de la cit&eacute; de fange<br>
Comme un ver qui d&eacute;robe &agrave; l'Homme ce qu'il mange.<br>
On entend &ccedil;&agrave; et l&agrave; les cuisines siffler,<br>
Les th&eacute;&acirc;tres glapir, les orchestres ronfler;<br>
Les tables d'h&ocirc;te, dont le jeu fait les d&eacute;lices,<br>
S'emplissent de catins et d'escrocs, leurs complices,<br>
Et les voleurs, qui n'ont ni tr&ecirc;ve ni merci,<br>
Vont bient&ocirc;t commencer leur travail, eux aussi,<br>
Et forcer doucement les portes et les caisses<br>
Pour vivre quelques jours et v&ecirc;tir leurs ma&icirc;tresses.<br>
</p>

<p>
Recueille-toi, mon &acirc;me, en ce grave moment,<br>
Et ferme ton oreille &agrave; ce rugissement.<br>
C'est l'heure o&ugrave; les douleurs des malades s'aigrissent!<br>
La sombre Nuit les prend &agrave; la gorge; ils finissent<br>
Leur destin&eacute;e et vont vers le gouffre commun;<br>
L'h&ocirc;pital se remplit de leurs soupirs. &mdash; Plus d'un<br>
Ne viendra plus chercher la soupe parfum&eacute;e,<br>
Au coin du feu, le soir, aupr&egrave;s d'une &acirc;me aim&eacute;e.<br>
</p>

<p>
Encore la plupart n'ont-ils jamais connu<br>
La douceur du foyer et n'ont jamais v&eacute;cu!<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>Twilight</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Behold the sweet evening, friend of the criminal; <br>
It comes like an accomplice, stealthily; the sky <br>
Closes slowly like an immense alcove, <br>
And impatient man turns into a beast of prey. <br>
O evening, kind evening, desired by him <br>
Whose arms can say, without lying: "Today <br>
We labored!" &mdash; It is the evening that comforts <br>
Those minds that are consumed by a savage sorrow, <br>
The obstinate scholar whose head bends with fatigue <br>
And the bowed laborer who returns to his bed.<br>
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile in the atmosphere malefic demons <br>
Awaken sluggishly, like businessmen, <br>
And take flight, bumping against porch roofs and shutters. <br>
Among the gas flames worried by the wind <br>
Prostitution catches alight in the streets; <br>
Like an ant-hill she lets her workers out; <br>
Everywhere she blazes a secret path, <br>
Like an enemy who plans a surprise attack; <br>
She moves in the heart of the city of mire <br>
Like a worm that steals from Man what he eats. <br>
Here and there one hears food sizzle in the kitchens, <br>
The theaters yell, the orchestras moan;<br>
</p>

<p>
The gambling dens, where games of chance delight, <br>
Fill up with whores and cardsharps, their accomplices; <br>
The burglars, who know neither respite nor mercy, <br>
Are soon going to begin their work, they also, <br>
And quietly force open cash-boxes and doors <br>
To enjoy life awhile and dress their mistresses.<br>
</p>

<p>
Meditate, O my soul, in this solemn moment, <br>
And close your ears to this uproar; <br>
It is now that the pains of the sick grow sharper! <br>
Somber Night grabs them by the throat; they reach the end <br>
Of their destinies and go to the common pit; <br>
The hospitals are filled with their sighs. &mdash; More than one <br>
Will come no more to get his fragrant soup <br>
By the fireside, in the evening, with a loved one.<br>
</p>

<p>
However, most of them have never known <br>
The sweetness of a home, have never lived!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Evening Twilight</b>
</p>

<p>
Delightful evening, partner of the crook, <br>
Steals in, wolf-padded, like a complice: look: <br>
Heaven, like a garret, closes to the day, <br>
And Man, impatient, turns a beast of prey.<br>
</p>

<p>
Sweet evening, loved by those whose arms can tell, <br>
Without a lie, "Today we've laboured well:" <br>
Sweet evening, it is she who brings relief <br>
To men with souls devoured by one fierce grief, <br>
Obstinate thinkers drowsy in the head, <br>
And toil-bent workmen groping to their bed.<br>
</p>

<p>
But insalubrious demons of the airs, <br>
Like business people, wake to their affairs <br>
And, flying, knock, like bats, on walls and shutters.<br>
Now Prostitution lights up in the gutters <br>
Across the glimmering jets the wind torments. <br>
Like a huge ant-hive it unseals its vents. <br>
On every side it weaves its hidden tracks <br>
Like enemies preparing night-attacks. <br>
It squirms within the City's breast of mire, <br>
A worm that steals the food that men desire.<br>
</p>

<p>
One hears the kitchens hissing here and there, <br>
Operas squealing, orchestras ablare. <br>
Cheap tables d'h&ocirc;te, where gaming lights the eyes, <br>
Fill up with whores, and sharpers, their allies: <br>
And thieves, whose office knows no truce nor rest, <br>
Will shortly now start working, too, with zest, <br>
Gently unhinging doors and forcing tills, <br>
To live some days and buy their sweethearts frills.<br>
</p>

<p>
Collect yourself, my soul, in this grave hour <br>
And shut your ears against the din and stour. <br>
It is the hour when sick men's pains increase. <br>
Death grips them by the throat, and soon they cease <br>
Their destined task, to find the common pit. <br>
The ward is filled with sighings. Out of it <br>
Not all return the scented soup to taste, <br>
Warm at the hearthside, by some loved-one placed.<br>
</p>

<p>
But then how few among them can recall <br>
Joys of the hearth, or ever lived at all!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>

<b>Comes The Charming Evening</b>
</p>

<p>
Comes the charming evening, the criminal's friend,<br>
Comes conspirator-like on soft wolf tread.<br>
Like a large alcove the sky slowly closes,<br>
And man approaches his bestial metamorphosis.<br>
</p>

<p>
To arms that have laboured, evening is kind enough,<br>
Easing the strain of sinews that have borne their rough<br>
Share of the burden; it is evening that relents<br>
To those whom an angry obsession daily haunts.<br>
The solitary student now raises a burdened head<br>
And the back that bent daylong sinks into its bed.<br>
Meanwhile darkness dawns, filled with demon familiars<br>
</p>

<p>
Who rouse, reluctant as business-men, to their affairs,<br>
Their ponderous flight rattling the shutters and blinds.<br>
Against the lamplight, whose shivering is the wind's,<br>
Prostitution spreads its light and life in the streetsÂ :<br>
Like an anthill opening its issues it penetrates<br>
Mysteriously everywhere by its own occult route;<br>
Like an enemy mining the foundations of a fort,<br>
Or a worm in an apple, eating what all should eat,<br>
It circulates securely in the city's clogged heart.<br>
The heat and hiss of kitchens can be felt here and there,<br>
The panting of heavy bands, the theatres' clamour.<br>
Cheap hotels, the haunts of dubious solaces,<br>
Are filling with tarts, and crooks, their sleek accomplices,<br>
And thieves, who have never heard of restraint or remorse,<br>
Return now to their work as a matter of course,<br>
Forcing safes behind carefully re-locked doors,<br>
To get a few days' living and put clothes on their whores.<br>
</p>

<p>
Collect yourself, my soul, this is a serious moment,<br>
Pay no further attention to the noise and movement.<br>
This is the hour when the pains of the sick sharpen,<br>
Night touches them like a torturer, pushes them to the open<br>
Trapdoor over the gulf that is all too common.<br>
Their groans overflow the hospital. More than one<br>
Will not come back to taste the soup's familiar flavour<br>
In the evening, with some friendly soul, by his own fire.<br>
</p>

<p>
Indeed, many a one has never even known<br>
The hearth's warm charm. Pity such a one.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; David Paul, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: New Directions, 1955)

<b>Le Cr&eacute;puscule du soir</b><br>
</p>

<p>
'tis witching night, the criminal's ally;<br>
it comes accomplice-like, wolf-soft; the sky<br>
slowly is closing every giant door,<br>
and man the rebel turns a beast once more.<br>
</p>

<p>
o Night, delicious Night, they sigh for thee<br>
&mdash; all those whose arms complain, and truly: we<br>
have toiled today! her solace and her peace<br>
Night brings to souls where cankering woes increase<br>
&mdash; the self-willed scholar, nodding drowsily,<br>
the workman bowed and hurrying bedward, free.<br>
but now the evil demons of the air<br>
wake heavily, like folk with many a care,<br>
and, soaring, dash their heads on wall or blind.<br>
among the gas-jets flickering in the wind<br>
from every door, a hive that swarms a new,<br>
pale Prostitution lights each avenue;<br>
clearing her secret ways where lechers crawl<br>
as might a foe who undermines a wall;<br>
gorging on what we need, she nightly squirms<br>
across the mire and darkness, like the worms.<br>
the kitchens rattle 'round us everywhere,<br>
playhouses roar and bands of music blare,<br>
swindlers and bawds ally themselves to fleece<br>
in wine shops, those who seek the cards' caprice,<br>
while thieves, who truce nor mercy never knew,<br>
will very soon resume their struggles too,<br>
and gently force the door where treasure is<br>
to feed themselves and dress their mistresses.<br>
</p>

<p>
awake, my soul, in this grave hour of sin<br>
and close thin ear to all its clamorous din.<br>
now is the time when sick men's woes increase!<br>
the murky night is throttling them; &mdash; they cease<br>
to breathe, and sink into the Gulf, undone.<br>
their groanings fill the poor house. &mdash; more than one <br>
will seek no more at dusk his savoury bowl<br>
beside the hearth, near some belov&egrave;d soul.<br>
</p>

<p>
and most of these have never known the call<br>
of home, nor had a hearth, nor lived at all!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Lewis Piaget Shanks, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (New York: Ives Washburn, 1931)<br>

<p>
<b>Evening Twilight</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Now is the graceful evening, friend of the criminal; <br>
Now it comes like an accomplice, stealthily; the sky <br>
Closes slowly like a gigantic bedroom, <br>
And Man, impatient, changes to wild beast.<br>
</p>

<p>
O evening, lovable eveningtime, longed for by him <br>
Whose arms can truthfully say: Today <br>
We have worked! &mdash; It is evening that lightens <br>
Spirits consumed by a fierce sorrow, <br>
The stubborn savant whose forehead grows heavy, <br>
And the bent laborer gaining again his bed.<br>
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile unhealthy demons heavily awake,<br>
Like business men, in the atmosphere,<br>
And fly and strike the shutters and the awning.<br>
Across those lights the wind tortures<br>
Prostitution is ignited in the streets;<br>
Like an ant-hill she opens her escapes,<br>
Spawning all over a secret path,<br>
Like an enemy's sudden attack;<br>
She stirs on the breast of the city of dung<br>
Like a worm that steals his meals from Man.<br>
Here and there one hears kitchens hissing,<br>
The screaming of theatres and orchestras roaring;<br>
The plain tables, where gambling throws its pleasures,<br>
Fill up with bawds and cheats, accomplices,<br>
And thieves, who know no truce nor grace,<br>
Soon go to get to work, they also,<br>
Depart to force gently safes and doors<br>
For a few days' living and to clothe their mistresses.<br>
</p>

<p>
Reflect, O my soul, in this most solemn time,<br>
And close your ears to this roar.<br>
It is the hour when the sorrows of the ill are sharpened.<br>
Dark Night grips them by the throat; they fulfill<br>
</p>

<p>
Their fate and move into the common whirlpool; <br>
The hospitals are full of their sighing.  &mdash; More than one <br>
Will no more come back to seek the perfumed soup, <br>
Beside the fire, at night, by a beloved soul.<br>
</p>

<p>
Still most, most of them have never known <br>
Home's sweetness nor have they really lived.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Geoffrey Wagner, <i>Selected Poems of Charles Baudelaire</i> (NY: Grove Press, 1974) <br>
