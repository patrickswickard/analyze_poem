<b><i>La servante au grand coeur dont vous &eacute;tiez jalouse</i></b><br>
</p>

<p>
La servante au grand coeur dont vous &eacute;tiez jalouse,<br>
Et qui dort son sommeil sous une humble pelouse,<br>
Nous devrions pourtant lui porter quelques fleurs.<br>
Les morts, les pauvres morts, ont de grandes douleurs,<br>
Et quand Octobre souffle, &eacute;mondeur des vieux arbres,<br>
Son vent m&eacute;lancolique &agrave; l'entour de leurs marbres,<br>
Certe, ils doivent trouver les vivants bien ingrats,<br>
&Agrave; dormir, comme ils font, chaudement dans leurs draps,<br>
Tandis que, d&eacute;vor&eacute;s de noires songeries,<br>
Sans compagnon de lit, sans bonnes causeries,<br>
Vieux squelettes gel&eacute;s travaill&eacute;s par le ver,<br>
Ils sentent s'&eacute;goutter les neiges de l'hiver<br>
Et le si&egrave;cle couler, sans qu'amis ni famille<br>
Remplacent les lambeaux qui pendent &agrave; leur grille.<br>
Lorsque la b&ucirc;che siffle et chante, si le soir<br>
Calme, dans le fauteuil je la voyais s'asseoir,<br>
Si, par une nuit bleue et froide de d&eacute;cembre,<br>
Je la trouvais tapie en un coin de ma chambre,<br>
Grave, et venant du fond de son lit &eacute;ternel<br>
Couver l'enfant grandi de son oeil maternel,<br>
Que pourrais-je r&eacute;pondre &agrave; cette &acirc;me pieuse,<br>
Voyant tomber des pleurs de sa paupi&egrave;re creuse?<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b><i>The Kind-Hearted Servant of Whom You Were Jealous</i></b><br>
</p>

<p>
The kind-hearted servant of whom you were jealous, <br>
Who sleeps her sleep beneath a humble plot of grass, <br>
We must by all means take her some flowers. <br>
The dead, ah! the poor dead suffer great pains, <br>
And when October, the pruner of old trees, blows <br>
His melancholy breath about their marble tombs, <br>
Surely they must think the living most ungrateful, <br>
To sleep, as they do, between warm, white sheets, <br>
While, devoured by gloomy reveries, <br>
Without bedfellows, without pleasant causeries, <br>
Old, frozen skeletons, belabored by the worm, <br>
They feel the drip of winter's snow, <br>
The passing of the years; nor friends, nor family <br>
Replace the dead flowers that hang on their tombs.<br>
</p>

<p>
If, some evening, when the fire-log whistles and sings <br>
I saw her sit down calmly in the great armchair, <br>
If, on a cold, blue night in December, <br>
I found her ensconced in a corner of my room, <br>
Grave, having come from her eternal bed <br>
Maternally to watch over her grown-up child, <br>
What could I reply to that pious soul, <br>
Seeing tears fall from her hollow eyelids?<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b><i>Now the Great-Hearted Servant, Who Aroused</i></b>
</p>

<p>
Now the great-hearted servant, who aroused <br>
Your jealousy, in humble earth is housed, <br>
Let's take, at least, some flowers for her relief. <br>
The dead, the piteous dead, know piercing grief, <br>
And when October blows, to prune old trees, <br>
And whistles round the marble where they freeze, <br>
How thankless then we living must appear <br>
Between warm sheets to sleep in comfort here, <br>
While, eaten by black dreams, they lie in woe <br>
Warm bedmates and their gossip to forego, <br>
Frostbitten skeletons, tunneled by vermin, <br>
To bear the moulting drip of Winter's ermine, <br>
For ages, with no friends nor kindred there <br>
The tatters on their railings to repair.<br>
</p>

<p>
On evenings when the hearthlogs hiss and flare <br>
Were I to see her calmly take her chair: <br>
Or, in the calm and blue December gloom, <br>
Huddle within the corner of my room, <br>
Gravely returning from her bed eternal <br>
To tend this grown-up child with the maternal <br>
Care of old times &mdash; how could I then reply <br>
To see the tears roll from each hollow eye?<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>

<p>
<b>The Servant</b><br>
</p>

<p>
My old nurse and servant, whose great heart<br>
made you jealous, is dead and sleeps apart<br>
from us. Shouldn't we bring her a few flowers?<br>
The dead, the poor dead, they have their bad hours,<br>
and when October stripper of old trees,<br>
poisons the turf and makes their marble freeze,<br>
surely they find us worse than wolves or curs<br>
for sleeping under mountainous warm furs...<br>
These, eaten by the earth's black dream, lie dead,<br>
without a wife or friend to warm their bed,<br>
old skeletons sunk like shrubs in burlap bags &mdash;<br>
and feel the ages trickle through their rags.<br>
They have no heirs or relatives to chase<br>
with children round their crosses and replace <br>
the potted refuse, where they lie beneath<br>
their final flower, the interment wreath.<br>
</p>

<p>
The oak log sings and sputters in my chamber<br>
and in the cold blue half-light of December,<br>
I see her tiptoe through my room, and halt<br>
humbly, as if she'd hurried from her vault<br>
with blankets for the child her sleepless eye<br>
had coaxed and mothered to maturity.<br>
What can I say to her to calm her fears?<br>
My nurse's hollow sockets fill with tears.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Robert Lowell, from Marthiel &amp; Jackson Matthews, eds., <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: New Directions, 1963)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Old Servant</b><br>
</p>

<p>
The servant that we had, you were so jealous of, <br>
I think we might at least lay flowers on her grave. <br>
Good creature, she's beneath the sod... and we're above; <br>
The dead, poor things, what valid grievances they have! <br>
And, when October comes, stripping the wood of leaves, <br>
And round their marble slabs the wind of autumn grieves, <br>
Surely, a living man must seem to the cold dead <br>
Somewhat unfeeling, sound asleep in his warm bed, <br>
While, gnawed by blacker dreams than any we have known &mdash; <br>
Lovers, good conversation, every pleasure gone &mdash; <br>
Old bones concerning which the worm has had his say, <br>
They feel the heavy snows of winter drip away, <br>
And years go by, and no one from the sagging vase <br>
Lifts the dried flowers to put fresh flowers in their place.<br>
</p>

<p>
Some evening, when the whistling log begins to purr,<br>
Supposing, in that chair, appeared the ghost of her;<br>
Supposing, on some cold and blue December night,<br>
I found her in my room, humble, half out of sight,<br>
And thoughtful, having come from her eternal bed <br>
To shield her grown-up child, to soothe his troubled head, <br>
What could I find to say to the poor faithful soul, &mdash; <br>
Seeing the tears beneath those sunken eyelids roll?<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Edna St. Vincent Millay, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>

Two editions of <i>Fleurs du mal</i> were published in Baudelaire's lifetime &mdash; one in 1857 and an expanded edition in 1861. "Scraps" and censored poems were collected in <i>Les &Eacute;paves</i> in 1866. After Baudelaire died the following year, a "definitive" edition appeared in 1868.
