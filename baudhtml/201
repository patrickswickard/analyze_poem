<b>Le Masque</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Statue all&eacute;gorique dans le go&ucirc;t de la Renaissance<br>
</p>

<p>
<i>&Agrave; Ernest Christophe, statuaire</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>
Contemplons ce tr&eacute;sor de gr&acirc;ces florentines;<br>
Dans l'ondulation de ce corps musculeux<br>
L'El&eacute;gance et la Force abondent, soeurs divines.<br>
Cette femme, morceau vraiment miraculeux,<br>
Divinement robuste, adorablement mince,<br>
Est faite pour tr&ocirc;ner sur des lits somptueux<br>
Et charmer les loisirs d'un pontife ou d'un prince.<br>
<br>
&mdash; Aussi, vois ce souris fin et voluptueux<br>
O&ugrave; la Fatuit&eacute; prom&egrave;ne son extase;<br>
Ce long regard sournois, langoureux et moqueur;<br>
Ce visage mignard, tout encadr&eacute; de gaze,<br>
Dont chaque trait nous dit avec un air vainqueur:<br>
&laquo;La Volupt&eacute; m'appelle et l'Amour me couronne!&raquo;<br>
&Agrave; cet &ecirc;tre dou&eacute; de tant de majest&eacute;<br>
Vois quel charme excitant la gentillesse donne!<br>
Approchons, et tournons autour de sa beaut&eacute;.<br>
</p>

<p>
&Ocirc; blasph&egrave;me de l'art! &ocirc; surprise fatale!<br>
La femme au corps divin, promettant le bonheur,<br>
Par le haut se termine en monstre bic&eacute;phale!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Mais non! ce n'est qu'un masque, un d&eacute;cor suborneur,<br>
Ce visage &eacute;clair&eacute; d'une exquise grimace,<br>
Et, regarde, voici, crisp&eacute;e atrocement,<br>
La v&eacute;ritable t&ecirc;te, et la sinc&egrave;re face<br>
Renvers&eacute;e &agrave; l'abri de la face qui ment<br>
Pauvre grande beaut&eacute;! le magnifique fleuve<br>
De tes pleurs aboutit dans mon coeur soucieux<br>
Ton mensonge m'enivre, et mon &acirc;me s'abreuve<br>
Aux flots que la Douleur fait jaillir de tes yeux!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Mais pourquoi pleure-t-elle? Elle, beaut&eacute; parfaite,<br>
Qui mettrait &agrave; ses pieds le genre humain vaincu,<br>
Quel mal myst&eacute;rieux ronge son flanc d'athl&egrave;te?<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Elle pleure insens&eacute;, parce qu'elle a v&eacute;cu!<br>
Et parce qu'elle vit! Mais ce qu'elle d&eacute;plore<br>
Surtout, ce qui la fait fr&eacute;mir jusqu'aux genoux,<br>
C'est que demain, h&eacute;las! il faudra vivre encore!<br>
Demain, apr&egrave;s-demain et toujours! &mdash; comme nous!<br>

<b>The Mask</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Allegorical Statue in the Style of the Renaissance<br>
To Ernest Christophe, Sculptor<br>
</p>

<p>
Let us gaze at this gem of Florentine beauty; <br>
In the undulation of this brawny body <br>
Those divine sisters, Gracefulness and Strength, abound. <br>
This woman, a truly miraculous marble, <br>
Adorably slender, divinely robust, <br>
Is made to be enthroned upon sumptuous beds <br>
And to charm the leisure of a Pope or a Prince.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; And see that smile, voluptuous and delicate, <br>
Where self-conceit displays its ecstasy; <br>
That sly, lingering look, mocking and languorous; <br>
That dainty face, framed in a veil of gauze, <br>
Whose every feature says, with a triumphant air: <br>
"Pleasure calls me and Love gives me a crown!" <br>
To that being endowed with so much majesty <br>
See what exciting charm is lent by prettiness!<br>
Let us draw near, and walk around its loveliness.<br>
</p>

<p>
O blasphemy of art! Fatal surprise! <br>
That exquisite body, that promise of delight, <br>
At the top turns into a two-headed monster!<br>
</p>

<p>
Why no! it's but a mask, a lying ornament, <br>
That visage enlivened by a dainty grimace, <br>
And look, here is, atrociously shriveled, <br>
The real, true head, the sincere countenance <br>
Reversed and hidden by the lying face. <br>
Poor glamorous beauty! the magnificent stream <br>
Of your tears flows into my anguished heart; <br>
Your falsehood makes me drunk and my soul slakes its thirst <br>
At the flood from your eyes, which Suffering causes!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; But why is she weeping? She, the perfect beauty, <br>
Who could put at her feet the conquered human race, <br>
What secret malady gnaws at those sturdy flanks?<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; She is weeping, fool, because she has lived!<br>
And because she lives! But what she deplores<br>
Most, what makes her shudder down to her knees,<br>
Is that tomorrow, alas! she will still have to live!<br>
Tomorrow, after tomorrow, always! &mdash; like us!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>

<b>The Mask</b>
</p>

<p>
(An allegoric statue in Renaissance style)<br>
</p>

<p>
To Ernest Christophe, sculptor<br>
</p>

<p>
Study with me this Florentinian treasure, <br>
Whose undulous and muscular design <br>
Welds Grace with Strength in sisterhood divine; <br>
A marvel only wonderment can measure, <br>
Divinely strong, superbly slim and fine, <br>
She's formed to reign upon a bed of pleasure <br>
And charm some prince or pontiff in his leisure.<br>
</p>

<p>
See, too, her smile voluptuously shine, <br>
Where sheer frivolity displays its sign: <br>
That lingering look of languor, guile, and cheek, <br>
The dainty face, which veils of gauze enshrine, <br>
That seems in conquering accents thus to speak:<br>
</p>

<p>
"Pleasure commands me. Love my brow has crowned!' <br>
Enamouring our thoughts in humble duty, <br>
True majesty with merriment is found. <br>
Approach, let's take a turn about her beauty. <br>
O blasphemy! Dread shock! Our hopes to pique, <br>
This lovely body, promising delight, <br>
Ends at the top in a two-headed freak.<br>
</p>

<p>
But no! it's just a mask that tricked our sight, <br>
Fooling us with that exquisite grimace: <br>
On the reverse you see her proper face, <br>
Fiercely convulsed, in its true self revealed, <br>
Which from our sight that lying mask concealed.<br>
&mdash; O sad great beauty! The grand river, fed <br>
By your rich tears, debouches in my heart. <br>
Though I am rapt with your deceptive art,<br>
My soul is slaked upon the tears you shed.<br>
</p>

<p>
And yet why does she weep? Such peerless grace <br>
Could trample down the conquered human race. <br>
What evil gnaws her flank so strong and sleek?<br>
</p>

<p>
She weeps because she's lived, and that she lives. <br>
Madly she weeps for that. But more she grieves <br>
(And at the knees she trembles and goes weak) <br>
Because tomorrow she must live, and then <br>
The next day, and forever &mdash; like us men.<br>
</p>

<b>The Mask</b>
</p>

<p>
<i>An allegorical statue in Renaissance style<br>
to Ernest Christophe, sculptor</i>
</p>

<p>
This beauty, she, this Renaissance of art,<br>
This ripe Italian elegance, where strength<br>
And loveliness entwine, divinely joined,<br>
Coiling through her lithe and sinuous length,<br>
She, full and muscular and marble-fleshed,<br>
Shaped to lounge in silk-and-satin guile,<br>
To throne a scarlet boudoir for a prince<br>
Or pope &mdash;<br>
</p>


<p>
See the smooth voluptuous smile<br>
That tells of ecstasy in idleness;<br>
The witty glance, languorous and sly,<br>
That dainty twist of head, that says to us<br>
As if in consummating triumph: “Lie<br>
With me in lust and after call me Love!”<br>
The thrill of her intangible caress,<br>
Majestic, breathing paradise!<br>
Come, walk around her gay seductiveness . . . .<br>
</p>

<p>
O blasphemy of art!  O weird surprise!<br>
The goddess’ torso, rising in its grace,<br>
Curves into a double-headed freak!<br>
</p>

<p>
But no! the one’s a mask, an unreal face,<br>
Alas, so tempting in its piquancy,<br>
But now you see a sorrowful revealing,<br>
The true, substantial head, the face in grief,<br>
Reversed behind in artful double-dealing.<br>
Pathetic, lovely lady: sumptuous flow<br>
Your tears: they burst upon my soul; they start<br>
My thoughts all reeling; I stagger, drowning here<br>
As miseries overflow your troubled heart.<br>
</p>

<p>
Yet why does she weep?  She, invincible,<br>
Where at her feet a race of men must bow,<br>
What frailty gnaws at her Olympian thigh?<br>
</p>

<p>
She suffers, fool, for living then and now.<br>
And even more, the tear falls from her eye,<br>
Emotion shakes her tremulous knees,<br>
Because tomorrow she will live the lie,<br>
And then tomorrow too, like you and I.<br>
</p>

<b>The Mask</b><br>
</p>

<p>
An Allegorical Statue in Renaissance Style<br>
</p>

<p>
Behold this prize of beauties wholly Florentine,<br>
See in this muscled body, lithe and sinuous,<br>
Divine concinnity married to strength divine.<br>
This woman sculpted by hands that wrought, miraculous.<br>
So strangely strong, and so strangely slim in scope,<br>
She was born to throne on beds made rich and sumptuous<br>
To charm the happy leisure of a Prince or Pope.<br>
</p>

<p>
Behold these smiling lips, suave and voluptuous,<br>
Whose ecstasies of arrant self-love give us pause;<br>
The mocking pawkishness of that long languid stare,<br>
Those dainty features framed in luminous light gauze,<br>
Whose every facet says with an all-conquering air:<br>
&quot;Lo, Pleasure calls and Love crowns my triumphant head!&quot;<br>
On this proud creature vested with such stateliness,<br>
See what exciting charms her daintiness has shed.<br>
Let us draw close and walk around her. O excess,<br>
O blasphemy of Art! O treachery unique!<br>
That body filled with promise, rapturous and rare,<br>
Turns at the top into a double-headed freak!<br>
</p>

<p>
No, this is but a mask, a decorative snare,<br>
Poor visage lighted by a delicate grimace!<br>
And look! contracted here, in raw and hideous troubles,<br>
The genuine head and the authentic, candid face<br>
Are overturned and darkened by their lying doubles.<br>
Poor noble beauty, the magnificent broad river<br>
Of your sad tears flows through my heart; your lie of lies<br>
Intoxicates me, and my thirsty soul aquiver<br>
Is slaked by the salt flood Pain dredges from your eyes.<br>
</p>

<p>
But why is it she weeps, whose loveliness outranks<br>
All others, and who binds all humans by her laws?<br>
What hushed mysterious ill gnaws at her athlete flanks?<br>
She weeps because, O madman, she has lived, because<br>
She must live on. But her most pitiful misgiving &mdash; <br>
What chills her very knees and turns her tremulous &mdash; <br>
Is that alas! tomorrow she must go on living &mdash; <br>
Tomorrow and tomorrow &mdash; evermore &mdash; like us!<br>
</p>

</p>

<p>
<i>To Ernest Christophe, sculptor</i>
</p>

<p>
Observe the Florentine grand style, and trace<br>
How in this body's sinuous soft curves<br>
Twin goddesses are present, Force and Grace;<br>
Truly she is miraculous, deserves<br>
In her delicious strength and suppleness<br>
To be enthroned on some most sumptuous bed<br>
And charm a king's or pontiff's idleness.<br>
</p>

<p>
Observe again where self-conceit is led<br>
To steal enjoyment from this tempting smile;<br>
This languid, sinister and mocking air;<br>
This coy regard, concealed beneath a veil,<br>
In which victorious lineaments declare<br>
"I am called Pleasure, and am crowned by Love."<br>
What thrilling charm informs her majesty<br>
This moving gentleness goes far to prove.<br>
Let us go near and walk around her beauty.<br>
</p>

<p>
Oh ! blasphemy of art! Oh ! fatal shock!<br>
The divine body, which appeared to ask<br>
Us to our pleasure, has two heads that mock!<br>
</p>

<p>
No ! these exquisite features are a mask,<br>
Mere debased ornament with fine grimace;<br>
Behind, atrociously contorted, is<br>
The veritable head, the sincere face<br>
Turned to the shadow of this face which lies.<br>
Poor perfect beauty, a grand river breaks<br>
As your tears fall into my anxious soul,<br>
I am drunk with your lie, my spirit slakes<br>
Its torture in the stream your eyes unroll.<br>
</p>

<p>
Why is she weeping ? In her lovely pride<br>
She could have conquered the whole race of man;<br>
What unknown evil harrows her lithe side?<br>
</p>

<p>
She weeps, mad girl, because her life began;<br>
Because she lives. One thing she does deplore<br>
So much that she kneels trembling in the dust &mdash; <br>
That she must live tomorrow, evermore,<br>
Tomorrow and tomorrow &mdash; as we must!<br>
</p>

<p>
