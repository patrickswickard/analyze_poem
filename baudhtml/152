<b>Franciscae meae laudes</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Novis te cantabo chordis,<br>
O novelletum quod ludis<br>
In solitudine cordis.<br>
</p>

<p>
Esto sertis implicata,<br>
&Ocirc; femina delicata<br>
Per quam solvuntur peccata!<br>
</p>

<p>
Sicut beneficum Lethe,<br>
Hauriam oscula de te,<br>
Quae imbuta es magnete.<br>
</p>

<p>
Quum vitiorum tempegtas<br>
Turbabat omnes semitas,<br>
Apparuisti, Deitas,<br>
</p>

<p>
Velut stella salutaris<br>
In naufragiis amaris.....<br>
Suspendam cor tuis aris!<br>
</p>

<p>
Piscina plena virtutis,<br>
Fons &aelig;tern&aelig; juventutis<br>
Labris vocem redde mutis!<br>
</p>

<p>
Quod erat spurcum, cremasti;<br>
Quod rudius, exaequasti;<br>
Quod debile, confirmasti.<br>
</p>

<p>
In fame mea taberna<br>
In nocte mea lucerna,<br>
Recte me semper guberna.<br>
</p>

<p>
Adde nunc vires viribus,<br>
Dulce balneum suavibus<br>
Unguentatum odoribus!<br>
</p>

<p>
Meos circa lumbos mica,<br>
O castitatis lorica,<br>
Aqua tincta seraphica;<br>
</p>

<p>
Patera gemmis corusca,<br>
Panis salsus, mollis esca,<br>
Divinum vinum, Francisca!<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>In Praise of My Frances</b><br>
</p>

<p>
I'll sing to you on a new note, <br>
O young hind that gambols gaily <br>
In the solitude of my heart.<br>
</p>

<p>
Be adorned with wreaths of flowers, <br>
O delightful woman <br>
By whom our sins are washed away!<br>
</p>

<p>
As from a benign Lethe, <br>
I shall drink kisses from you, <br>
Who were given a magnet's strength.<br>
</p>

<p>
When a tempest of vices<br>
Was sweeping down on every path,<br>
You appeared, O divinity!<br>
</p>

<p>
Like the star of salvation<br>
Above a disastrous shipwreck...<br>
I shall place my heart on your altar!<br>
</p>

<p>
Reservoir full of virtue, <br>
Fountain of eternal youth, <br>
Restore the voice to my mute lips!<br>
</p>

<p>
You have burned that which was filthy, <br>
Made smooth that which was rough, <br>
Strengthened that which was weak.<br>
</p>

<p>
In my hunger you are the inn, <br>
In the darkness my lamp, <br>
Lead me always on virtue's path.<br>
</p>

<p>
Add your strength now to my strength,<br>
Sweet bath scented<br>
With pleasant perfumes!<br>
</p>

<p>
Shine forth from my loins,<br>
O cuirass of chastity,<br>
That was dipped in seraphic water,<br>
</p>

<p>
Cup glittering with precious stones, <br>
Bread seasoned with salt, delectable dish, <br>
Heavenly wine &mdash; My Frances.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Praises of My Francisca</b>
</p>

<p>
(Verses to a learned and devout Milliner)<br>
</p>

<p>
Upon new chords of you I sing. <br>
And the new-born bud you bring <br>
From solitude, the pure heart's Spring.<br>
</p>

<p>
Your brows should be with garlands twined <br>
Woman of delightful mind, <br>
Who our trespasses unbind.<br>
</p>

<p>
As the wondrous balm of Lethe, <br>
Through thy kisses, I will breathe thee. <br>
All are magnetised who see thee.<br>
</p>

<p>
When my vices, wild and stormy,<br>
From my wonted courses bore me<br>
It was You appeared before me,<br>
</p>

<p>
Star of Oceans! you that alter <br>
Courses, when the pilots falter &mdash; <br>
Take my heart upon your altar.<br>
</p>

<p>
Cistern full of virtuous ruth, <br>
Fountain of eternal youth, <br>
Give to dumbness speech and truth!<br>
</p>

<p>
What was dirty, you cremated, <br>
What uneven &mdash; you equated, <br>
What was weak you re-created.<br>
</p>

<p>
Inn, on the hungry roads I tramp, <br>
And, in the dark, a guiding lamp <br>
To steer the lost one back to camp.<br>
</p>

<p>
To my strength add strength, O sweet <br>
Bath, where scents and unguents meet! <br>
Anoint me for some peerless feat!<br>
</p>

<p>
Holy water most seraphic, <br>
On the lusts in which I traffic <br>
Flash your chastity ecstatic.<br>
</p>

<p>
Bowl of gems where radiance dances. <br>
Salt that the holy bread enhances, <br>
And sacred wine &mdash; your name is Frances!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>


<p>
<b>Francescae Meae Laudes</b><br>
</p>

<p>
I shall sing new chords, O hind, <br>
As you gambol unconfined <br>
Through my solitary mind.<br>
</p>

<p>
Rest, adorned with wreaths of flowers,<br>
Comely woman whose vast powers<br>
Wash away these sins of ours<br>
</p>

<p>
As from Lethe's stream I shall<br>
Drink your kisses, one and all,<br>
Magnet-like and magical.<br>
</p>

<p>
When our vices stormily <br>
Swept down every path with glee, <br>
You approved, O Deity!<br>
</p>

<p>
Like the bright star of salvation<br>
Amid shipwreck's desolation &mdash; <br>
Take my heart in rapt oblation.<br>
</p>

<p>
Source of every good and store<br>
Of eternal youth, restore<br>
Song to my mute lips once more.<br>
</p>

<p>
What was foul you calcinated<br>
What was rough you Ievigated,<br>
What was weak you stimulated.<br>
</p>

<p>
In my hunger, you the inn,<br>
In my dark, the lamp; and in<br>
Your pale hands, an end to sin.<br>
</p>

<p>
Add your strength to mine, new-sent,<br>
Sweet bath ever redolent<br>
Of the suaver perfumes blent.<br>
</p>

<p>
From my loins, gleam radiantly<br>
O cuirass of chastity<br>
Steeped in balm seraphically.<br>
</p>

<p>
Cup with precious gems ashine,<br>
Savory bread, celestial wine,<br>
Blessed food, Francesca mine!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jacques LeClercq, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (Mt Vernon, NY: Peter Pauper Press, 1958)<br>

Two editions of <i>Fleurs du mal</i> were published in Baudelaire's lifetime &mdash; one in 1857 and an expanded edition in 1861. "Scraps" and censored poems were collected in <i>Les &Eacute;paves</i> in 1866. After Baudelaire died the following year, a "definitive" edition appeared in 1868.
