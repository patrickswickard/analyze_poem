<b>Le Balcon</b><br>
</p>

<p>
M&egrave;re des souvenirs, ma&icirc;tresse des ma&icirc;tresses,<br>
&Ocirc; toi, tous mes plaisirs! &ocirc; toi, tous mes devoirs!<br>
Tu te rappelleras la beaut&eacute; des caresses,<br>
La douceur du foyer et le charme des soirs,<br>
M&egrave;re des souvenirs, ma&icirc;tresse des ma&icirc;tresses!<br>
</p>

<p>
Les soirs illumin&eacute;s par l'ardeur du charbon,<br>
Et les soirs au balcon, voil&eacute;s de vapeurs roses.<br>
Que ton sein m'&eacute;tait doux! que ton coeur m'&eacute;tait bon!<br>
Nous avons dit souvent d'imp&eacute;rissables choses<br>
Les soirs illumin&eacute;s par l'ardeur du charbon.<br>
</p>

<p>
Que les soleils sont beaux dans les chaudes soir&eacute;es!<br>
Que l'espace est profond! que le coeur est puissant!<br>
En me penchant vers toi, reine des ador&eacute;es,<br>
Je croyais respirer le parfum de ton sang.<br>
Que les soleils sont beaux dans les chaudes soir&eacute;es!<br>
</p>

<p>
La nuit s'&eacute;paississait ainsi qu'une cloison,<br>
Et mes yeux dans le noir devinaient tes prunelles,<br>
Et je buvais ton souffle, &ocirc; douceur! &ocirc; poison!<br>
Et tes pieds s'endormaient dans mes mains fraternelles.<br>
La nuit s'&eacute;paississait ainsi qu'une cloison.<br>
</p>

<p>
Je sais l'art d'&eacute;voquer les minutes heureuses,<br>
Et revis mon pass&eacute; blotti dans tes genoux.<br>
Car &agrave; quoi bon chercher tes beaut&eacute;s langoureuses<br>
Ailleurs qu'en ton cher corps et qu'en ton coeur si doux?<br>
Je sais l'art d'&eacute;voquer les minutes heureuses!<br>
</p>

<p>
Ces serments, ces parfums, ces baisers infinis,<br>
Rena&icirc;tront-ils d'un gouffre interdit &agrave; nos sondes,<br>
Comme montent au ciel les soleils rajeunis<br>
Apr&egrave;s s'&ecirc;tre lav&eacute;s au fond des mers profondes?<br>
&mdash; &Ocirc; serments! &ocirc; parfums! &ocirc; baisers infinis!<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>The Balcony</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Mother of memories, mistress of mistresses,<br>
O you, all my pleasure, O you, all my duty!<br>
You'll remember the sweetness of our caresses,<br>
The peace of the fireside, the charm of the evenings.<br>
Mother of memories, mistress of mistresses!<br>
</p>

<p>
The evenings lighted by the glow of the coals, <br>
The evenings on the balcony, veiled with rose mist; <br>
How soft your breast was to me! how kind was your heart! <br>
We often said imperishable things, <br>
The evenings lighted by the glow of the coals.<br>
</p>

<p>
How splendid the sunsets are on warm evenings!<br>
How deep space is! how potent is the heart!<br>
In bending over you, queen of adored women,<br>
I thought I breathed the perfume in your blood.<br>
How splendid the sunsets are on warm evenings!<br>
</p>

<p>
The night was growing dense like an encircling wall, <br>
My eyes in the darkness felt the fire of your gaze <br>
And I drank in your breath, O sweetness, O poison! <br>
And your feet nestled soft in my brotherly hands. <br>
The night was growing dense like an encircling wall.<br>
</p>

<p>
I know the art of evoking happy moments, <br>
And live again our past, my head laid on your knees, <br>
For what's the good of seeking your languid beauty <br>
Elsewhere than in your dear body and gentle heart? <br>
I know the art of evoking happy moments.<br>
</p>

<p>
Those vows, those perfumes, those infinite kisses, <br>
Will they be reborn from a gulf we may not sound, <br>
As rejuvenated suns rise in the heavens <br>
After being bathed in the depths of deep seas?<br>
&mdash; O vows! O perfumes! O infinite kisses!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Balcony</b>
</p>

<p>
Mother of memories, queen of paramours, <br>
Yourself are all my pleasure, all my duty; <br>
You will recall caresses that were yours <br>
And fireside evenings in their warmth and beauty. <br>
Mother of memories, queen of paramours.<br>
</p>

<p>
On eves illumined by the light of coal, <br>
The balcony beneath a rose-veiled sky, <br>
Your breast how soft! Your heart how good and whole! <br>
We spoke eternal things that cannot die &mdash; <br>
On eves illumined by the light of coal!<br>
</p>

<p>
How splendid sets the sun of a warm evening! <br>
How deep is space! the heart how full of power! <br>
When, queen of the adored, towards you leaning, <br>
I breathed the perfume of your blood in flower. <br>
How splendid sets the sun of a warm evening!<br>
</p>

<p>
The evening like an alcove seemed to thicken, <br>
And as my eyes astrologised your own, <br>
Drinking your breath, I felt sweet poisons quicken, <br>
And in my hands your feet slept still as stone. <br>
The evening like an alcove seemed to thicken.<br>
</p>

<p>
I know how to resuscitate dead minutes. <br>
I see my past, its face hid in your knees. <br>
How can I seek your languorous charm save in its <br>
Own source, your heart and body formed to please. <br>
I know how to resuscitate dead minutes.<br>
</p>

<p>
These vows, these perfumes, and these countless kisses, <br>
Reborn from gulfs that we could never sound, <br>
Will they, like suns, once bathed in those abysses, <br>
Rejuvenated from the deep, rebound &mdash; <br>
These vows, these perfumes, and these countless kisses?<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>

<p>
<b>The Balcony</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Inspirer of my youth, mistress beyond compare,<br>
You who were all my pleasures, all my hopes and dreams!<br>
Do you recall our cheerful room &mdash; our evenings there,<br>
Quiet and passionate? Like yesterday, it seems,<br>
Inspirer of my youth, mistress beyond compare!<br>
</p>

<p>
The evenings lighted by the hushed flame of the coal, <br>
The warm rose-misted twilights in the early springs, <br>
The balcony! How I adored you, body and soul! <br>
And, darling, we have said imperishable things <br>
The evenings lighted by the hushed flame of the coal.<br>
</p>

<p>
How splendid were the long slow summer sunsets, too!<br>
How large the world appeared to us! How strong and good<br>
Life ran then in our veins! When I leaned close to you<br>
I thought that I could breathe the perfume of your blood.<br>
How splendid were the long slow summer sunsets, too!<br>
</p>

<p>
The night would close around us like a dim blue wall, <br>
And your eyes flashed within the darkness, and the sweet <br>
Drug of your breath came over me. Do you recall <br>
How I would love to lie for hours holding your feet? <br>
The night would close around us like a dim blue wall.<br>
</p>

<p>
I can relive the ecstasy that Time has slain; <br>
At moments I can feel myself between your thighs. <br>
What use to hope for anything like that again <br>
With someone else? What use to seek in any wise? <br>
I can relive the ecstasy that Time has slain.<br>
</p>

<p>
Those cries, those long embraces, that remembered scent:<br>
Can they be lost for ever? Will they not come round<br>
Like stars, like suns, to blaze upon the firmament<br>
Of future worlds, from the abyss we cannot sound?<br>
&mdash; O cries! O long embraces! O remembered scent!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; George Dillon, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>

<p>
<b>The Balcony</b>
</p>
 
<p>
Mother of memories, mistress of all blisses,<br>
Of all my works and pleasures, you, the queen;<br>
Reflection of the loveliness of kisses<br>
By the fireside in twilight’s gray serene,<br>
Mother of memories, mistress of all blisses!<br>
</p>

<p>
Illumined evenings with the coals aglow.<br>
On the balcony, the rosy mists ascending,<br>
How soft your breast, your blood how warm the flow!<br>
We spoke of things undying, love unending &mdash;<br>
Illumined evenings with the coals aglow.<br>
</p>

<p>
The sunsets of the summer’s fading gold!<br>
The beating of our hearts, that soft sensation!<br>
And as I leaned toward you, and my love told,<br>
I seemed to breathe your blood’s intoxication.<br>
The sunsets of the summer’s fading gold!<br>
</p>

<p>
The night enclosed us two in silent cover.<br>
My eyes could see the black of yours still shine,<br>
Of your sweet breath I drank the poison, lover!<br>
Your feet I held till daybreak as if mine.<br>
The night enclosed us two in silent cover.<br>
</p>

<p>
I know the art of bringing back the past <br>
And see the times I snuggled in your thighs.<br>
Your languorous beauties, certainly they last<br>
Still in your dear heart and your sweet sighs.<br>
I know the art of bringing back the past!<br>
</p>

<p>
The oaths and perfumes, kisses without number,<br>
They come again in spite of time’s curfew,<br>
As when the rising sun revives from slumber,<br>
From caverns of the seas, now washed anew.<br>
&mdash; O oaths, o perfumes, o kisses without number!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Edward Eriksson

<b>The Balcony</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Mistress of mistresses, mother of memories, <br>
O you my every pleasure, you my every duty! <br>
You shall recall our blandishments and ecstasies, <br>
The warm peace of our hearth, the evening's placid beauty. <br>
Mistress of mistresses, mother of memories!<br>
</p>

<p>
Evenings illumined by the glow of coals afire <br>
Or on the balcony, veiled in a rosy mist. <br>
How soft your breast, how kind your heart to my desire! <br>
We said imperishable things the while we kissed, <br>
Evenings illumined by the glow of coals afire.<br>
</p>

<p>
How glorious the sunset on warm summer nights! <br>
How deep space is! the human heart how competent! <br>
As I bent over you, queen of my soul's delight, <br>
I thought I breathed your blood with its suave acrid scent. <br>
How glorious the sunset on warm summer nights!<br>
</p>

<p>
The night grew dense, forming a wall to compass us, <br>
Across the dark your eyes bound mine with golden bands, <br>
I drank your breath in deep, O sweet, O poisonous! <br>
Your slender feet slept softly in my gentle hands. <br>
The night grew dense, forming a wall to compass us.<br>
</p>

<p>
The resurrection of glad moments is an art <br>
I know: I live anew, my head pressed to your knees, <br>
For where, if not in your loved flesh and tender heart,<br>
Can I seek out the wonder of your languidness?<br>
The resurrection of glad moments is an art.<br>
</p>

<p>
These vows, these fragrant scents, these kisses without end,<br>
Shall they be born again out of infinity?<br>
As suns rejuvenated in the skies ascend,<br>
Having been laved in the unfathomable sea?<br>
&mdash; O vows! O fragrant scents! &mdash; O kisses without end!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jacques LeClercq, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (Mt Vernon, NY: Peter Pauper Press, 1958)<br>

<p>
<b>The Balcony</b>
</p>

<p>
Oh, Mother of Memories! Mistress of Mistresses! <br>
Oh, thou all my pleasures, oh, thou all my prayers! <br>
Can'st thou remember those luscious caresses, <br>
The charm of the hearth and the sweet evening airs? <br>
Oh, Mother of Memories, Mistress of Mistresses! <br>
</p>

<p>
Those evenings illumed by the glow of the coal, <br>
And those roseate nights with their vaporous wings, <br>
How calm was thy breast and how good was thy soul, <br>
'Twas then we uttered imperishable things, <br>
Those evenings illumed by the glow of the coal. <br>
</p>

<p>
How lovely the suns on those hot, autumn nights! <br>
How vast were the heavens! and the heart how hale! <br>
As I leaned towards you &mdash; oh, my Queen of Delights, <br>
The scent of thy blood I seemed to inhale. <br>
How lovely the sun on those hot, autumn nights! <br>
</p>

<p>
The shadows of night-time grew dense like a pall, <br>
And deep through the darkness thine eyes I divined, <br>
And I drank of thy breath &mdash; oh sweetness, oh gall, <br>
And thy feet in my brotherly hands reclined, <br>
The shadows of Night-time grew dense like a pall. <br>
</p>

<p>
I know how to call forth those moments so dear, <br>
And to live my Past &mdash; laid on thy knees &mdash; once more, <br>
For where should I seek for thy beauties but here <br>
In thy langorous heart and thy body so pure? <br>
I know how to call forth those moments so dear. <br>
</p>

<p>
Those perfumes, those infinite kisses and sighs, <br>
Are they born in some gulf to our plummets denied? <br>
Like rejuvenate suns that mount up to the skies, <br>
That first have been cleansed in the depths of the tide;<br>
Oh, perfumes! oh, infinite kisses and sighs! <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Cyril Scott, <i>Baudelaire: The Flowers of Evil</i> (London: Elkin Mathews, 1909)

<b>Le Balcon</b><br>
</p>

<p>
mother of memories, mistress of mistresses <br>
&mdash; thou, all my pleasure, thou, my fealties all!<br>
thou shalt recall each kiss how soft it is,<br>
how warm our hearth, the night how magical,<br>
mother of memories, mistress of mistresses!<br>
</p>

<p>
long hours illumined by the glowing fire<br>
long balcony-hours veiled with misty rose;<br>
soft pillowing breast! heart warm to my desire!<br>
and all the imperishable things we whispered, those<br>
long hours illumined by the glowing fire<br>
</p>

<p>
how softly shone the golden, shimmering sun!<br>
how deep the skyey space! how rich love's power!<br>
for bending toward thee, most belov&egrave;d one,<br>
I seemed to breathe thy pulses like a flower.<br>
how softly shone the golden, shimmering sun!<br>
</p>

<p>
Night with her thickening wall imprisoned us,<br>
eyes groped for  widening eyes the black withheld,<br>
I drank thy breath, o sweet, o poisonous!<br>
thy feet slept in my hands fraternal held;<br>
Night with her thickening wall imprisoned us.<br>
</p>

<p>
my magic art evoked a rapture perished,<br>
for in thy clasp I saw my youth afresh,<br>
could others yield the languorous charm I cherished,<br>
thy gentle heart, thy dear and lovely flesh?<br>
my magic art evoked a rapture perished!<br>
</p>

<p>
but &mdash; vows and fragrance, infinite desire &mdash;<br>
shall they arise from gulfs too deep to plumb,<br>
as morn by morn new suns of rosier fire<br>
mount, laved in some dark sea Elysium?<br>
o vows! o fragrance! infinite desire!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Lewis Piaget Shanks, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (New York: Ives Washburn, 1931)<br>

<p>
<b>The Balcony</b>
</p>

<p>
Mother of memories, mistress of mistresses,<br>
O thou, my pleasure, thou, all my desire,<br>
Thou shalt recall the beauty of caresses,<br>
The charm of evenings by the gentle fire,<br>
Mother of memories, mistress of mistresses!<br>
</p>

<p>
The eves illumined by the burning coal,<br>
The balcony where veiled rose-vapour clings &mdash; <br>
How soft your breast was then, how sweet your soul!<br>
Ah, and we said imperishable things,<br>
Those eves illumined by the burning coal.<br>
</p>

<p>
Lovely the suns were in those twilights warm,<br>
And space profound, and strong life's pulsing flood,<br>
In bending o'er you, queen of every charm,<br>
I thought I breathed the perfume in your blood.<br>
The suns were beauteous in those twilights warm.<br>
</p>

<p>
The film of night flowed round and over us,<br>
And my eyes in the dark did your eyes meet;<br>
I drank your breath, ah! sweet and poisonous,<br>
And in my hands fraternal slept your feet &mdash; <br>
Night, like a film, flowed round and over us.<br>
</p>

<p>
I can recall those happy days forgot,<br>
And see, with head bowed on your knees, my past.<br>
Your languid beauties now would move me not<br>
Did not your gentle heart and body cast<br>
The old spell of those happy days forgot.<br>
</p>

<p>
Can vows and perfumes, kisses infinite,<br>
Be reborn from the gulf we cannot sound;<br>
As rise to heaven suns once again made bright<br>
After being plunged in deep seas and profound?<br>
Ah, vows and perfumes, kisses infinite!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; F.P. Sturm, from <i>Baudelaire: His Prose and Poetry</i>, edited by Thomas Robert Smith (New York: Boni and Liveright, 1919)

Two editions of <i>Fleurs du mal</i> were published in Baudelaire's lifetime &mdash; one in 1857 and an expanded edition in 1861. "Scraps" and censored poems were collected in <i>Les &Eacute;paves</i> in 1866. After Baudelaire died the following year, a "definitive" edition appeared in 1868.
