<b>Lesbos</b><br>
</p>

<p>
M&egrave;re des jeux latins et des volupt&eacute;s grecques,<br>
Lesbos, o&ugrave; les baisers, languissants ou joyeux, <br>
Chauds comme les soleils, frais comme les past&egrave;ques, <br>
Font l'ornement des nuits et des jours glorieux, <br>
M&egrave;re des jeux latins et des volupt&eacute;s grecques, <br>
</p>

<p>
Lesbos, o&ugrave; les baisers sont comme les cascades <br>
Qui se jettent sans peur dans les gouffres sans fonds, <br>
Et courent, sanglotant et gloussant par saccades, <br>
Orageux et secrets, fourmillants et profonds; <br>
Lesbos, o&ugrave; les baisers sont comme les cascades! <br>
</p>

<p>
Lesbos, o&ugrave; les Phryn&eacute;s l'une l'autre s'attirent, <br>
O&ugrave; jamais un soupir ne resta sans &eacute;cho, <br>
&Agrave; l'&eacute;gal de Paphos les &eacute;toiles t'admirent, <br>
Et V&eacute;nus &agrave; bon droit peut jalouser Sapho!<br>
Lesbos o&ugrave; les Phryn&eacute;s l'une l'autre s'attirent, <br>
</p>

<p>
Lesbos, terre des nuits chaudes et langoureuses, <br>
Qui font qu'&agrave; leurs miroirs, st&eacute;rile volupt&eacute;! <br>
Les filles aux yeux creux, de leur corps amoureuses, <br>
Caressent les fruits m&ucirc;rs de leur nubilit&eacute;; <br>
Lesbos, terre des nuits chaudes et langoureuses, <br>
</p>

<p>
Laisse du vieux Platon se froncer l'oeil aust&egrave;re; <br>
Tu tires ton pardon de l'exc&egrave;s des baisers, <br>
Reine du doux empire, aimable et noble terre, <br>
Et des raffinements toujours in&eacute;puis&eacute;s. <br>
Laisse du vieux Platon se froncer l'oeil aust&egrave;re. <br>
</p>

<p>
Tu tires ton pardon de l'&eacute;ternel martyre, <br>
Inflig&eacute; sans rel&acirc;che aux coeurs ambitieux, <br>
Qu'attire loin de nous le radieux sourire <br>
Entrevu vaguement au bord des autres cieux! <br>
Tu tires ton pardon de l'&eacute;ternel martyre! <br>
</p>

<p>
Qui des Dieux osera, Lesbos, &ecirc;tre ton juge <br>
Et condamner ton front p&acirc;li dans les travaux, <br>
Si ses balances d'or n'ont pes&eacute; le d&eacute;luge <br>
De larmes qu'&agrave; la mer ont vers&eacute; tes ruisseaux? <br>
Qui des Dieux osera, Lesbos, &ecirc;tre ton juge? <br>
</p>

<p>
Que nous veulent les lois du juste et de l'injuste ? <br>
Vierges au coeur sublime, honneur de l'archipel, <br>
Votre religion comme une autre est auguste, <br>
Et l'amour se rira de l'Enfer et du Ciel! <br>
Que nous veulent les lois du juste et de l'injuste? <br>
</p>

<p>
Car Lesbos entre tous m'a choisi sur la terre <br>
Pour chanter le secret de ses vierges en fleurs, <br>
Et je fus d&egrave;s l'enfance admis au noir myst&egrave;re <br>
Des rires effr&eacute;n&eacute;s m&ecirc;l&eacute;s aux sombres pleurs; <br>
Car Lesbos entre tous m'a choisi sur la terre. <br>
</p>

<p>
Et depuis lors je veille au sommet de Leucate, <br>
Comme une sentinelle &agrave; l'oeil per&ccedil;ant et s&ucirc;r, <br>
Qui guette nuit et jour brick, tartane ou fr&eacute;gate, <br>
Dont les formes au loin frissonnent dans l'azur; <br>
Et depuis lors je veille au sommet de Leucate, <br>
</p>

<p>
Pour savoir si la mer est indulgente et bonne, <br>
Et parmi les sanglots dont le roc retentit <br>
Un soir ram&egrave;nera vers Lesbos, qui pardonne, <br>
Le cadavre ador&eacute; de Sapho, qui partit <br>
Pour savoir si la mer est indulgente et bonne! <br>
</p>

<p>
De la m&acirc;le Sapho, l'amante et le po&egrave;te, <br>
Plus belle que V&eacute;nus par ses mornes p&acirc;leurs! <br>
&mdash; L'oeil d'azur est vaincu par l'oeil noir que tach&egrave;te <br>
Le cercle t&eacute;n&eacute;breux trac&eacute; par les douleurs <br>
De la m&acirc;le Sapho, l'amante et le po&egrave;te! <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Plus belle que V&eacute;nus se dressant sur le monde <br>
Et versant les tr&eacute;sors de sa s&eacute;r&eacute;nit&eacute; <br>
Et le rayonnement de sa jeunesse blonde <br>
Sur le vieil Oc&eacute;an de sa fille enchant&eacute;; <br>
Plus belle que V&eacute;nus se dressant sur le monde! <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; De Sapho qui mourut le jour de son blasph&egrave;me, <br>
Quand, insultant le rite et le culte invent&eacute;, <br>
Elle fit son beau corps la p&acirc;ture supr&ecirc;me <br>
D'un brutal dont l'orgueil punit l'impi&eacute;t&eacute; <br>
De celle qui mourut le jour de son blasph&egrave;me. <br>
</p>

<p>
Et c'est depuis ce temps que Lesbos se lamente, <br>
Et, malgr&eacute; les honneurs que lui rend l'univers, <br>
S'enivre chaque nuit du cri de la tourmente <br>
Que poussent vers les cieux ses rivages d&eacute;serts. <br>
Et c'est depuis ce temps que Lesbos se lamente! 
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>Lesbos</b>
</p>

<p>
Mother of Latin games and Greek delights,<br>
Lesbos, where kisses, languishing or joyous,<br>
Burning as the sun's light, cool as melons,<br>
Adorn the nights and the glorious days;<br>
Mother of Latin games and Greek delights,<br>
</p>

<p>
Lesbos, where the kisses are like cascades <br>
That throw themselves boldly into bottomless chasms <br>
And flow, sobbing and gurgling intermittently, <br>
Stormy and secret, teeming and profound; <br>
Lesbos, where the kisses are like cascades!<br>
</p>

<p>
Lesbos, where courtesans feel drawn toward each other,<br>
Where for every sigh there is an answering sigh,<br>
The stars admire you as much as Paphos,<br>
And Venus may rightly be jealous of Sappho!<br>
Lesbos, where courtesans feel drawn toward each other,<br>
</p>

<p>
Lesbos, land of hot and languorous nights,<br>
That make the hollow-eyed girls, amorous<br>
Of their own bodies, caress before their mirrors<br>
The ripe fruits of their nubility, O sterile pleasure!<br>
Lesbos, land of hot and languorous nights,<br>
</p>

<p>
Let old Plato look on you with an austere eye; <br>
You earn pardon by the excess of your kisses <br>
And the inexhaustible refinements of your love, <br>
Queen of the sweet empire, pleasant and noble land. <br>
Let old Plato look on you with an austere eye.<br>
</p>

<p>
You earn pardon by the eternal martyrdom <br>
Inflicted ceaselessly upon aspiring hearts <br>
Who are lured far from us by radiant smiles <br>
Vaguely glimpsed at the edge of other skies!<br>
You earn pardon by that eternal martyrdom!<br>
</p>

<p>
Which of the gods will dare to be your judge, Lesbos, <br>
And condemn your brow, grown pallid from your labors, <br>
If his golden scales have not weighed the flood <br>
Of tears your streams have poured into the sea? <br>
Which of the gods will dare to be your judge, Lesbos?<br>
</p>

<p>
What are to us the laws of the just and unjust <br>
Virgins with sublime hearts, honor of these islands; <br>
Your religion, like any other, is august, <br>
And love will laugh at Heaven and at Hell! <br>
What are to us the laws of the just and unjust?<br>
</p>

<p>
For Lesbos chose me among all other poets <br>
To sing the secret of her virgins in their bloom, <br>
And from childhood I witnessed the dark mystery <br>
Of unbridled laughter mingled with tears of gloom; <br>
For Lesbos chose me among all other poets.<br>
</p>

<p>
And since then I watch from Leucadia's summit,<br>
Like a sentry with sure and piercing eyes<br>
Who looks night and day for tartane, brig or frigate,<br>
Whose forms in the distance flutter against the blue;<br>
And since then I watch from Leucadia's summit,<br>
</p>

<p>
To find out if the sea is indulgent and kind, <br>
If to the sobs with which the rocks resound <br>
It will bring back some night to Lesbos, who forgives, <br>
The worshipped body of Sappho, who departed <br>
To find out if the sea is indulgent and kind!<br>
</p>

<p>
Of the virile Sappho, paramour and poet, <br>
With her wan pallor, more beautiful than Venus!<br>
&mdash; The blue eyes were conquered by the black eyes, ringed <br>
With dark circles, traced by the sufferings <br>
Of the virile Sappho, paramour and poet!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Lovelier than Venus dominating the world,<br>
Pouring out the treasures of her serenity<br>
And the radiance of her golden-haired youth<br>
Upon old Ocean, delighted with his daughter;<br>
Lovelier than Venus dominating the world!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Of Sappho who died the day of her blasphemy, <br>
When, insulting the rite and the established cult, <br>
She made of her body the supreme pabulum <br>
Of a cruel brute whose pride punished the sacrilege <br>
Of her who died on the day of her blasphemy.<br>
</p>

<p>
And it is since that time that Lesbos mourns, <br>
And in spite of the homage the world renders her, <br>
Gets drunk every night with the tempest's howls <br>
Which are hurled at the skies by her deserted shores. <br>
And it is since that time that Lesbos mourns.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Lesbos</b>
</p>

<p>
Mother of Grecian joys and Latin games,<br>
Lesbos, where kisses, languishing or gay,<br>
As melons cool, or warm as solar flames,<br>
Adorn alike the glorious night and day:<br>
Mother of Grecian joys and Latin games,<br>
</p>

<p>
Lesbos of kisses reckless as cascades <br>
That hurl themselves to bottomless abysses, <br>
Stormy and secret, myriad-swarming kisses, <br>
That cluck and sob and gurgle in the shades. <br>
Lesbos of kisses reckless as cascades!<br>
</p>

<p>
Lesbos where Phrynes each to each are plighted,<br>
Where never yet unanswered went a sigh,<br>
Where Paphos with a rival is requited,<br>
And Venus with a Sappho has to vie!<br>
Lesbos where Phrynes each to each are plighted,<br>
</p>

<p>
Lesbos, the land of warm and languid night,<br>
Where gazing in their mirrors as they dress<br>
The cave-eyed girls, in barren, vain delight,<br>
The fruits of their nubility caress.<br>
Lesbos, the land of warm and languid night,<br>
</p>

<p>
Let Plato frown austerely all the while. <br>
Your pardon's from excess of kisses won, <br>
Queen of sweet empire, rare and noble isle &mdash; <br>
And from refinements which are never done.<br>
 Let Plato frown austerely all the while.<br>
</p>

<p>
From martyrdom your pardon you beguile,<br>
Inflicted without stint on hearts that soar <br>
Far, far away, drawn by some radiant smile <br>
Seen vaguely on a strange celestial shore. <br>
From martyrdom your pardon you beguile.<br>
</p>

<p>
Lesbos, what God to judge you would make bold, <br>
Or damn your brows so pale and sadly grave, <br>
Not having weighed upon the scales of gold <br>
The floods of tears you've poured into the wave. <br>
Lesbos which God to judge you would make bold?<br>
</p>

<p>
For us, what mean the statutes of the just? <br>
Pride of the isles, whose hearts sublimely swell, <br>
Your faith as any other is august <br>
And Love can laugh alike at Heaven and Hell. <br>
For us, what mean the statues of the just?<br>
</p>

<p>
For Lesbos chose me of all men on earth <br>
To sing the secrets of her virgin flowers, <br>
Taught as a child the sacred rites of mirth <br>
And mysteries of sorrow which are ours. <br>
So Lesbos chose me of all men on earth.<br>
</p>

<p>
Since then I watch on the Leucadian height. <br>
Like a lone sentry with a piercing view <br>
Who sees the vessels ere they heave in sight <br>
With forms that faintly tremble in the blue. <br>
Since then I watch on the Leucadian height<br>
</p>

<p>
To find out if the sea's heart still is hardened <br>
And from the sobs that drench the rock with spray <br>
If it will bring back Sappho, who has pardoned, <br>
The corpse of the adored, who went away <br>
To find out that the sea its heart has hardened;<br>
</p>

<p>
Of the male Sappho, lover, queen of singers,<br>
More beautiful than Venus by her woes.<br>
The blue eye cannot match the black, where lingers<br>
The shady circle that her grief bestows<br>
On the male Sappho, lover, queen of singers &mdash; <br>
</p>

<p>
Fairer than Venus towering on the world<br>
And pouring down serenity like water<br>
In the blond radiance of her tresses curled<br>
To daze the very Ocean with her daughter,<br>
Fairer than Venus towering on the world &mdash; <br>
</p>

<p>
Of Sappho, whom her blasphemy requited <br>
The day she quit the rite and scorned the cult, <br>
And gave her lovely body to be slighted <br>
By a rough brute, whose scorn was the result <br>
For Sappho, whom the blasphemy requited.<br>
</p>

<p>
And since that time has Lesbos lived lamenting <br>
In spite of all the honours of mankind, <br>
And lives upon the storm-howl unrelenting <br>
Of its bleak shores, the sport of wave and wind: <br>
For since that time has Lesbos lived lamenting.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>

<p>
<b>Lesbos</b>
</p>

<p>
Mother of Latin revelry and of Greek delight,<br>
Lesbos, whereof the kisses, disconsolate or gay,<br>
Hot as the sun, or cool as melons plucked by night,<br>
Beguile the unshadowed and the shadowed hours away;<br>
Mother of Latin revelry and of Greek delight,<br>
</p>

<p>
Lesbos, whereof the kisses are whirlpools and cascades<br>
Journeying carelessly into a dark abyss:<br>
So wild the sobbing and laughter among thy colonnades,<br>
So secret, so profound, so stormy, every kiss!<br>
Lesbos, whereof the kisses are whirlpools and cascades!<br>
</p>

<p>
Lesbos, where the sweet slaves one to another yearn,<br>
Where there is never a glance without an echoing sign;<br>
Even as upon Cyprus the stars upon thee burn<br>
With praise, and Cyprus' queen is envious of thine,<br>
Lesbos, where the sweet slaves one to mother yearn &mdash; <br>
</p>

<p>
Lesbos, of sultry twilights and pure, infertile joy,<br>
Where deep-eyed maidens, thoughtlessly disrobing, see<br>
Their beauty, and are entranced before their mirrors, and toy<br>
Fondly with the soft fruits of their nubility;<br>
Lesbos, of sultry twilights and pure, infertile joy!<br>
</p>

<p>
Let frown the old lined forehead of Plato as it will: <br>
Thy pardon is assured &mdash; even by the strange excess, <br>
Luxurious isle, of thy long sterile rapture, still <br>
Contriving some new freak or form of tenderness; <br>
Let frown the old lined forehead of Plato as it will.<br>
</p>

<p>
Thy pardon has been bought with our eternal pain, <br>
The lonely martyrdom endured in every age <br>
By those who sigh for pleasures outlandish and insane <br>
To ease the unearthly longing no pleasure can assuage. <br>
Thy pardon has been bought with our eternal pain.<br>
</p>

<p>
Who, Lesbos, of the gods would dare pronounce thy fate <br>
And brand thy passionate white brow with infamy &mdash; <br>
Or hope by any art or science to estimate <br>
The tears, the tears thy streams have poured into the sea? <br>
Who, Lesbos, of the gods would dare pronounce thy fate?<br>
</p>

<p>
What are men's laws to us, injurious or benign? <br>
Proud virgins, glory of the Aegean! We know well <br>
Love, be it most foredoomed, most desperate, is divine, <br>
And love will always laugh at heaven and at hell! <br>
What are men's laws to us, injurious or benign?<br>
</p>

<p>
Lo! I was named by Lesbos of all the lists of earth <br>
To celebrate her sad-eyed girls and their sweet lore: <br>
And I have known from childhood the noise of loud, crazed mirth <br>
Confused mysteriously with terrible weeping &mdash; for <br>
Lo! I was named by Lesbos of all the lists of earth.<br>
</p>

<p>
And I have watched thenceforward from the Leucadian cliff,<br>
Like an unwearying old sentry, who can descry<br>
Far out on the horizon a sailboat or a skiff<br>
Invisible to others, with his sharp, practised eye;<br>
And I have watched thenceforward from the Leucadian cliff<br>
</p>

<p>
To find if the cold wave were pitiful and good &mdash; <br>
And someday I shall see come wandering home, I know, <br>
To all-forgiving Lesbos upon the twilight flood <br>
The sacred ruins of Sappho, who set forth long ago <br>
To find if the cold wave were pitiful and good;<br>
</p>

<p>
Of Sappho, poet and lover &mdash; the virile, calm, and brave, <br>
More beautiful than Venus, by force of earthly grief &mdash; <br>
More beautiful than blue-eyed Venus, with her grave <br>
And dusky glance disclosing the sorrows past belief <br>
Of Sappho, poet and lover &mdash; the virile, calm, and brave:<br>
</p>

<p>
More beautiful than Venus arising to the world<br>
And scattering all round her the iridescent fire<br>
Of her blond loveliness with rainbow hues impearled<br>
Upon the old green ocean, her bedazzled sire;<br>
More beautiful than Venus arising to the world!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Of Sappho, who died proudly the day of her soul's crime<br>
When, faithless to her teaching and to her serious pledge,<br>
She flung the occult dark roses of her love sublime<br>
To a vain churl. Alas! How deep the sacrilege<br>
Of Sappho, who died proudly the day of her soul's crime!<br>
</p>

<p>
And from that day to this the isle of Lesbos mourns &mdash;  <br>
And heedful of the world's late homage in no wise, <br>
Gives answer but with the hollow moaning of her wild bourns: <br>
The sea's long obloquy to the unlistening skies! <br>
And from that day to this the isle of Lesbos mourns.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; George Dillon, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Lesbos</b>
</p>

<p>
Mother of Latin sports and Greek delights,<br>
Where kisses languishing or pleasureful,<br>
Warm as the suns, as the water-melons cool,<br>
Adorn the glorious days and sleepless nights,<br>
Mother of Latin sports and Greek delights,<br>
</p>

<p>
Lesbos, where kisses are as waterfalls<br>
That fearless into gulfs unfathom'd leap,<br>
Now run with sobs, now slip with gentle brawls,<br>
Stormy and secret, manifold and deep;<br>
Lesbos, where kisses are as waterfalls!<br>
</p>

<p>
Lesbos, where Phryne Phryne to her draws,<br>
Where ne'er a sigh did echoless expire,<br>
As Paphos' equal thee the stars admire,<br>
Nor venus envies Sappho without cause!<br>
Lesbos, where Phryne Phryne to her draws,<br>
</p>

<p>
Lesbos, the land of warm and languorous nights,<br>
Where by their mirrors seeking sterile good,<br>
The girls with hollow eyes, in soft delights,<br>
Caress the ripe fruits of their womanhood,<br>
Lesbos, the land of warm and languorous nights.<br>
</p>

<p>
Leave, leave old Plato's austere eye to frown;<br>
Pardon is thine for kisses' sweet excess,<br>
Queen of the land of amiable renown,<br>
And for exhaustless subtleties of bliss,<br>
Leave, leave old Plato's austere eye to frown.<br>
</p>

<p>
Pardon is thine for the eternal pain<br>
That on the ambitious hearts for ever lies,<br>
Whom far from us the radiant smile could gain,<br>
Seen dimly on the verge of other skies;<br>
Pardon is thine for the eternal pain!<br>
</p>

<p>
Which of the gods will dare thy judge to be,<br>
And to condemn thy brown with labour pale,<br>
Not having balanced in his golden scale<br>
The flood of tears thy brooks pour'd in the sea?<br>
Which of the gods will dare thy judge to be?<br>
</p>

<p>
What boot the laws of just and of unjust?<br>
Great-hearted virgins, honour of the isles,<br>
Lo, your religion is also august,<br>
And love at hell and heaven together smiles!<br>
What boot the laws of just and of unjust?<br>
</p>

<p>
For Lesbos chose me out from all my peers,<br>
To sing the secret of her maids in flower,<br>
Opening the mystery dark from childhood's hour,<br>
Of frantic laughters, mix'd with sombre tears;<br>
For Lesbos chose me out from all my peers.<br>
</p>

<p>
And since I from Leucate's top survey,<br>
Like a sentinel with piercing eye and true,<br>
Watching for brig and frigate night and day,<br>
Whose distant outlines quiver in the bue,<br>
And since I from Leucate's top survey,<br>
</p>

<p>
To learn if kind and merciful the sea,<br>
And midst the sobs that make the rock resound,<br>
Brings back some eve to pardoning Lesbos, free<br>
The worshipp'd corpse of Sappho, who made her bound<br>
To learn if kind and merciful the sea!<br>
</p>

<p>
Of her the man-like lover-poetess,<br>
In her sad pallor more than Venus fair!<br>
The azure eye yields to that black eye, where<br>
The cloudy circle tells of the distress<br>
Of her the man-like lover-poetess!<br>
</p>

<p>
Fairer than Venus risen on the world,<br>
Pouring the treasures of her aspect mild,<br>
The radiance of her fair white youth unfurl'd<br>
On Ocean old enchanted with his child;<br>
Fairer than Venus risen on the world.<br>
</p>

<p>
Of Sappho, who, blaspheming, died that day<br>
When trampling on the rite and sacred creed,<br>
She made her body fair the supreme prey<br>
Of one whose pride punish'd the impious deed<br>
Of Sappho, who, blaspheming, died that day.<br>
</p>

<p>
And since that time it is that Lesbos moans,<br>
And, spite the homage which the whole world pays,<br>
Is drunk each night with cries of pain and groans,<br>
Her desert shores unto the heavens do raise,<br>
And since that time it is that Lesbos moans!<br>
</p>
