<b>Le Cr&eacute;puscule du matin</b><br>
</p>

<p>
La diane chantait dans les cours des casernes,<br>
Et le vent du matin soufflait sur les lanternes.<br>
</p>

<p>
C'&eacute;tait l'heure o&ugrave; l'essaim des r&ecirc;ves malfaisants<br>
Tord sur leurs oreillers les bruns adolescents;<br>
O&ugrave;, comme un oeil sanglant qui palpite et qui bouge,<br>
La lampe sur le jour fait une tache rouge;<br>
O&ugrave; l'&acirc;me, sous le poids du corps rev&ecirc;che et lourd,<br>
Imite les combats de la lampe et du jour.<br>
Comme un visage en pleurs que les brises essuient,<br>
L'air est plein du frisson des choses qui s'enfuient,<br>
Et l'homme est las d'&eacute;crire et la femme d'aimer.<br>
</p>

<p>
Les maisons &ccedil;&agrave; et l&agrave; commen&ccedil;aient &agrave; fumer.<br>
Les femmes de plaisir, la paupi&egrave;re livide,<br>
Bouche ouverte, dormaient de leur sommeil stupide;<br>
Les pauvresses, tra&icirc;nant leurs seins maigres et froids,<br>
Soufflaient sur leurs tisons et soufflaient sur leurs doigts.<br>
C'&eacute;tait l'heure o&ugrave; parmi le froid et la l&eacute;sine<br>
S'aggravent les douleurs des femmes en g&eacute;sine;<br>
Comme un sanglot coup&eacute; par un sang &eacute;cumeux<br>
Le chant du coq au loin d&eacute;chirait l'air brumeux<br>
Une mer de brouillards baignait les &eacute;difices,<br>
Et les agonisants dans le fond des hospices<br>
Poussaient leur dernier r&acirc;le en hoquets in&eacute;gaux.<br>
Les d&eacute;bauch&eacute;s rentraient, bris&eacute;s par leurs travaux.<br>
</p>

<p>
L'aurore grelottante en robe rose et verte<br>
S'avan&ccedil;ait lentement sur la Seine d&eacute;serte,<br>
Et le sombre Paris, en se frottant les yeux<br>
Empoignait ses outils, vieillard laborieux.<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>Dawn</b><br>
</p>

<p>
They were sounding reveille in the barracks' yards, <br>
And the morning wind was blowing on the lanterns.<br>
</p>

<p>
It was the hour when swarms of harmful dreams <br>
Make the sun-tanned adolescents toss in their beds; <br>
When, like a bloody eye that twitches and rolls, <br>
The lamp makes a red splash against the light of day; <br>
When the soul within the heavy, fretful body <br>
Imitates the struggle of the lamp and the sun. <br>
Like a tear-stained face being dried by the breeze, <br>
The air is full of the shudders of things that flee, <br>
And man is tired of writing and woman of making love.<br>
</p>

<p>
Here and there the houses were beginning to smoke. <br>
The ladies of pleasure, with eyelids yellow-green <br>
And mouths open, were sleeping their stupefied sleep; <br>
The beggar-women, their breasts hanging thin and cold, <br>
Were blowing on their fires, blowing on their fingers. <br>
It was the hour when amid poverty and cold <br>
The pains of women in labor grow more cruel; <br>
The cock's crow in the distance tore the foggy air <br>
Like a sob stifled by a bloody froth;<br>
</p>

<p>
The buildings were enveloped in a sea of mist, <br>
And in the charity-wards, the dying <br>
Hiccupped their death-sobs at uneven intervals. <br>
The rakes were going home, exhausted by their work.<br>
</p>

<p>
The dawn, shivering in her green and rose garment, <br>
Was moving slowly along the deserted Seine, <br>
And somber Paris, the industrious old man, <br>
Was rubbing his eyes and gathering up his tools.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>

<p>
<b>Morning Twilight</b>
</p>

<p>
Reveille in the barracks and the camps. <br>
The wind of morning blew upon the lamps. <br>
It was the hour when evil dreams in swarms <br>
On pillows twist brown, adolescent forms: <br>
When like a bleeding eye that's twitched with pain <br>
Each lantern smudged the day with crimson stain: <br>
The soul, against its body's weight of brawn, <br>
Lay struggling, like the lanterns with the dawn: <br>
Like a sad face whose tears the breezes dry <br>
The air grew tremulous with things that fly, <br>
And women tired of love, and men of writing.<br>
</p>

<p>
The chimneys, here and there, showed fires were lighting. <br>
Women of pleasure, slumber to be-slut, <br>
Lay open-mouthed with livid eyelids shut. <br>
Dangling thin dugs, cold pauper-women blew <br>
Upon the embers and their fingers too. <br>
It was the hour when, what with cold and squalor, <br>
Women in labour aggravate their dolour, <br>
And like a sob, choked short with bloody froth, <br>
The cock-crow tore the foggy air as cloth.<br>
</p>

<p>
Like seas the mists round every building poured <br>
While agonising patients in the ward, <br>
In broken hiccoughs, rattled out their lives: <br>
And worn-out rakes reeled homeward to their wives. <br>
Aurora, in a shift of rose and green, <br>
Came shivering down the Seine's deserted scene <br>
And Paris, as he rubbed his eyes, began <br>
To sort his tools, laborious old man.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>

<p>
<b>Dawn</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Outside the barracks now the bugle called, and woke <br>
The morning wind, which rose, making the lanterns smoke.<br>
</p>

<p>
It was that hour when tortured dreams of stealthy joys <br>
Twist in their beds the thin brown bodies of growing boys; <br>
When, like a blood-shot eye that blinks and looks away, <br>
The lamp still burns, and casts a red stain on the day; <br>
When the soul, pinned beneath the body's weight and brawn, <br>
Strives, as the lamplight strives to overcome the dawn; <br>
The air, like a sad face whose tears the breezes dry, <br>
Is tremulous with countless things about to die; <br>
And men grow tired of writing, and women of making love.<br>
</p>

<p>
Blue smoke was curling now from the cold chimneys of <br>
A house or two; with heavy lids, mouths open wide, <br>
Prostitutes slept their slumber dull and stupefied; <br>
While laborers' wives got up, with sucked-out breasts, and stood <br>
Blowing first on their hands, then on the flickering wood. <br>
It was that hour when cold, and lack of things they need, <br>
Combine, and women in childbirth have it hard indeed.<br>
</p>

<p>
Like a sob choked by frothy hemorrhage, somewhere <br>
Far-off a sudden cock-crow tore the misty air; <br>
A sea of fog rolled in, effacing roofs and walls; <br>
The dying, that all night in the bare hospitals <br>
Had fought for life, grew weaker, rattled, and fell dead; <br>
And gentlemen, debauched and drunk, swayed home to bed.<br>
</p>

<p>
Aurora now in a thin dress of green and rose, <br>
With chattering teeth advanced. Old somber Paris rose, <br>
Picked up its tools, and, over the deserted Seine, <br>
Yawning, rubbing its eyes, slouched forth to work again.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Edna St. Vincent Millay, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>

<br>

<p>
<b>Morning Twilight</b>
</p>

<p>
Reveille rang thinly from across a barrack square,<br>
And a breath of morning troubled the street-lamps' stare.<br>
</p>

<p>
It was that hour of the night when guilty dreams<br>
Rise from brown, restless adolescents in swarms,<br>
When, quaking and cringing like a blood-shot eye,<br>
The lamp stains the coming day with its dye;<br>
When under the body's reluctant, stubborn weight<br>
The soul, like the lamp, renews its unequal fight;<br>
When the air shivers as if to escape, to efface<br>
Itself in furtive breezes drying a tear-stung face;<br>
When woman is sick of love, as the writer of his work.<br>
</p>

<p>
Here and there a house sent up a thin smoke.<br>
Women of the streets, sunk in stupid sleep,<br>
Seemed all raw eyelid, and gasping lip.<br>
&mdash; And the poor's womenfolk, hugging the chilly droop<br>
Of lank breasts, blew on their fingers, and their soup.<br>
The extra pinch of cold, amid that of penury,<br>
Added, for women in labour, its insult to injury.<br>
Slitting the fogged air, the cry of a distant cock<br>
Broke like a jet of blood through the spasm of a cough.<br>
Buildings still swam in vague tides of mist;<br>
And in silenced hospitals, with a last<br>
Convulsive rattle, the dying gave up breath,<br>
&mdash; While night revellers staggered home, tired to death.<br>
</p>

<p>
Morning, shivering in her robe of rose and green,<br>
Made her hesitant way along the deserted Seine,<br>
While Paris, rubbing tired eyes in its dark,<br>
Woke like an ancient drudge to another day's work.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; David Paul, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: New Directions, 1955)

<p>
<b>Le Cr&eacute;puscule du matin</b><br>
</p>

<p>
across the barracks came the bugle-blare:<br>
the wind of dawn made all the street-lamps flare.<br>
</p>

<p>
it was the hour dreams of evil swarm<br>
and dark-eyed striplings writhe in pallets warm;<br>
when, like a bleeding, palpitating eye,<br>
the lamp's a red blot on the daylight sly:<br>
when the soul struggles, crushed and overborne<br>
by cumbering flesh, like lamplight with the morn.<br>
the air is full of quivering things; each flees<br>
like slackening tear-drops cancelled by the breeze,<br>
and poets tire of verse and maids of love.<br>
</p>

<p>
spirals of smoke arose, the roofs above.<br>
daughters of joy, wide-mouthed, with livid eye,<br>
lay drowned in stupid sleep, their lips awry;<br>
gaunt women, dragging breasts which hunger knew,<br>
breathed on their embers and their fingers blue.<br>
</p>

<p>
it was the hour that loads, by cold and dearth,<br>
the woes of mothers waiting to give birth;<br>
when, like a blood-choked sobbing cry, afar,<br>
a cock's crow tore the air crepuscular<br>
and each tall hive lay drowned in misty seas,<br>
while from the poorhouse wall of secrecies<br>
rang the last broken gasps of dying men.<br>
outside, rakes worn with toil rode home again.<br>
</p>

<p>
Dawn, in her green and rosy garment shivering,<br>
down the deserted Seine came loitering,<br>
and dark-browed Paris &mdash; toiler old and wise! &mdash;<br>
caught up his shovel, rubbing both his eyes.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Lewis Piaget Shanks, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (New York: Ives Washburn, 1931)<br>

<br>

<p>
<b>Morning Twilight</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Reveille was blown in the courtyards of barracks,<br>
And the morning wind fanned the lanterns.<br>
</p>

<p>
It was the hour when those swarms of unwholesome dreams <br>
Twist on their pillows the brown adolescents; <br>
When, like a bloody eye, throbbing and roving, <br>
The lamp marks the day with a red freckle, <br>
When the soul, burdened by the irritable, heavy body, <br>
Copies the struggles of the lamp and the day. <br>
Like a weeping face, wiped by breezes, <br>
The air is filled with quivering of escaping things <br>
And man is tired of writing and woman of loving.<br>
</p>

<p>
Here and there houses began to smoke. <br>
The ladies of delight, with livid eyelids, <br>
Mouths open, slept their futile sleep; <br>
Pauper women, dragging their thin, cold breasts, <br>
Blew on their brands and blew on their fingers. <br>
It was the hour when in cold and frugality <br>
The pangs of the laboring woman are quickened; <br>
Like a sob sliced by spumy blood <br>
The misty air was slashed by the song of the cock; <br>
A sea of fog bathed the buildings, <br>
And the agonized in the depths of asylums <br>
Uttered their last death-rattles in irregular hiccups. <br>
The debauchees returned, broken by their business.<br>
</p>

<p>
Dawn, chattering with cold, in its pink and green robe, <br>
Advanced slowly over the deserted Seine, <br>
And gray Paris, rubbing its eyes, <br>
Reached for its tools, like an aged workman.<br>
</p>
