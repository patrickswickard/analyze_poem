<b>Hymne &agrave; la Beaut&eacute;</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Viens-tu du ciel profond ou sors-tu de l'ab&icirc;me,<br>
O Beaut&eacute;? ton regard, infernal et divin,<br>
Verse confus&eacute;ment le bienfait et le crime,<br>
Et l'on peut pour cela te comparer au vin.<br>
</p>

<p>
Tu contiens dans ton oeil le couchant et l'aurore;<br>
Tu r&eacute;pands des parfums comme un soir orageux;<br>
Tes baisers sont un philtre et ta bouche une amphore<br>
Qui font le h&eacute;ros l&acirc;che et l'enfant courageux.<br>
</p>

<p>
Sors-tu du gouffre noir ou descends-tu des astres?<br>
Le Destin charm&eacute; suit tes jupons comme un chien;<br>
Tu s&egrave;mes au hasard la joie et les d&eacute;sastres,<br>
Et tu gouvernes tout et ne r&eacute;ponds de rien.<br>
</p>

<p>
Tu marches sur des morts, Beaut&eacute;, dont tu te moques;<br>
De tes bijoux l'Horreur n'est pas le moins charmant,<br>
Et le Meurtre, parmi tes plus ch&egrave;res breloques,<br>
Sur ton ventre orgueilleux danse amoureusement.<br>
</p>

<p>
L'&eacute;ph&eacute;m&egrave;re &eacute;bloui vole vers toi, chandelle,<br>
Cr&eacute;pite, flambe et dit: B&eacute;nissons ce flambeau!<br>
L'amoureux pantelant inclin&eacute; sur sa belle<br>
A l'air d'un moribond caressant son tombeau.<br>
</p>

<p>
Que tu viennes du ciel ou de l'enfer, qu'importe,<br>
&Ocirc; Beaut&eacute;! monstre &eacute;norme, effrayant, ing&eacute;nu!<br>
Si ton oeil, ton souris, ton pied, m'ouvrent la porte<br>
D'un Infini que j'aime et n'ai jamais connu?<br>
</p>

<p>
De Satan ou de Dieu, qu'importe? Ange ou Sir&egrave;ne,<br>
Qu'importe, si tu rends, &mdash; f&eacute;e aux yeux de velours,<br>
Rythme, parfum, lueur, &ocirc; mon unique reine! &mdash;<br>
L'univers moins hideux et les instants moins lourds?<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>Hymn to Beauty</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Do you come from Heaven or rise from the abyss, <br>
Beauty? Your gaze, divine and infernal, <br>
Pours out confusedly benevolence and crime, <br>
And one may for that, compare you to wine.<br>
</p>

<p>
You contain in your eyes the sunset and the dawn; <br>
You scatter perfumes like a stormy night; <br>
Your kisses are a philtre, your mouth an amphora, <br>
Which make the hero weak and the child courageous.<br>
</p>

<p>
Do you come from the stars or rise from the black pit? <br>
Destiny, bewitched, follows your skirts like a dog; <br>
You sow at random joy and disaster, <br>
And you govern all things but answer for nothing.<br>
</p>

<p>
You walk upon corpses which you mock, O Beauty! <br>
Of your jewels Horror is not the least charming, <br>
And Murder, among your dearest trinkets, <br>
Dances amorously upon your proud belly.<br>
</p>

<p>
The dazzled moth flies toward you, O candle!<br>
Crepitates, flames and says: "Blessed be this flambeau!"<br>
The panting lover bending o'er his fair one<br>
Looks like a dying man caressing his own tomb,<br>
</p>

<p>
Whether you come from heaven or from hell, who cares, <br>
O Beauty! Huge, fearful, ingenuous monster! <br>
If your regard, your smile, your foot, open for me <br>
An Infinite I love but have not ever known?<br>
</p>

<p>
From God or Satan, who cares? Angel or Siren, <br>
Who cares, if you make, &mdash; fay with the velvet eyes, <br>
Rhythm, perfume, glimmer; my one and only queen! <br>
The world less hideous, the minutes less leaden?<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<p>
<b>Hymn to Beauty</b>
</p>

<p>
Did you spring out of heaven or the abyss, <br>
Beauty? Your gaze infernal, yet divine, <br>
Spreads infamy and glory, grief and bliss, <br>
And therefore you can be compared to wine.<br>
</p>

<p>
Your eyes contain both sunset and aurora: <br>
You give off scents, like evenings storm-deflowered: <br>
Your kisses are a philtre: an amphora <br>
Your mouth, that cows the brave, and spurs the coward.<br>
</p>

<p>
Climb you from gulfs, or from the stars descend? <br>
Fate, like a fawning hound, to heel you've brought; <br>
You scatter joy and ruin without end, <br>
Ruling all things, yet answering for naught.<br>
</p>

<p>
You trample men to death, and mock their clamour. <br>
Amongst your gauds pale Horror gleams and glances, <br>
And Murder, not the least of them in glamour, <br>
On your proud belly amorously dances.<br>
</p>

<p>
The dazzled insect seeks your candle-rays, <br>
Crackles, and burns, and seems to bless his doom. <br>
The groom bent o'er his bride as in a daze, <br>
Seems, like a dying man, to stroke his tomb.<br>
</p>

<p>
What matter if from hell or heaven born, <br>
Tremendous monster, terrible to view? <br>
Your eyes and smile reveal to me, like morn, <br>
The Infinite I love but never knew.<br>
</p>

<p>
From God or Fiend? Siren or Sylph ? Invidious <br>
The answer &mdash; Fay with eyes of velvet, ray, <br>
Rhythm, and perfume! &mdash; if you make less hideous <br>
Our universe, less tedious leave our day.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>

<p>
<b>Hymn to Beauty</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Did you fall from high heaven or surge from the abyss, <br>
O Beauty? Your bright gaze, infernal and divine, <br>
Confusedly pours out courage and cowardice, <br>
Or love and crime. Therefore men liken you to wine.<br>
</p>

<p>
Your eyes hold all the sunset and the dawn, you are <br>
As rich in fragrances as a tempestuous night, <br>
Your kisses are a philtre and your mouth a jar <br>
Filling the child with valor and the man with fright.<br>
</p>

<p>
Did the stars mould you or the pit's obscurity? <br>
You bring at random Paradise or Juggernaut. <br>
Fate sniffs your skirts with a charmed dog's servility, <br>
You govern all and yet are answerable for naught.<br>
</p>

<p>
Beauty, you walk on corpses of dead men you mock. <br>
Among your store of gems, Horror is not the least; <br>
Murder, amid the dearest trinkets of your stock, <br>
Dances on your proud belly like a ruttish beast.<br>
</p>

<p>
Candle, the transient moth flies dazzled to your light, <br>
Crackles and flames and says: &quot;Bless&egrave;d this fiery doom!&quot; <br>
The panting lover with his mistress in the night <br>
Looks like a dying man caressing his own tomb.<br>
</p>

<p>
Are you from heaven or hell, Beauty that we adore? <br>
Who cares? A dreadful, huge, ingenuous monster, you!<br>
So but your glance, your smile, your foot open a door<br>
Upon an Infinite I love but never knew.<br>
</p>

<p>
From Satan or from God? Who cares? Fierce or serene,<br>
Who cares? Sister to sirens or to seraphim?<br>
So but, dark fey, you shed your perfume, rhythm and sheen<br>
To make the world less hideous and Time less grim.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jacques LeClercq, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (Mt Vernon, NY: Peter Pauper Press, 1958)<br>
</p>

<p>
<b>Hymn to Beauty</b>
</p>

<p>
From heaven or hell, O Beauty, come you hence?<br>
Out from your gaze, infernal and divine,<br>
Pours blended evil and beneficence,<br>
And therefore men have likened you to wine.<br>
</p>

<p>
Sunset and dawn within your eyes are fair;<br>
Stormlike you scatter perfume into space;<br>
Your kiss, a philtre from an amphora rare,<br>
Charms boys to courage and makes heroes base.<br>
</p>

<p>
Whence come you, from what spheres, or inky deeps,<br>
With careless hand joy and distress to strew?<br>
Fate, like a dog at heel, behind you creeps;<br>
You govern all things here, and naught you rue.<br>
</p>

<p>
You walk upon the dead with scornful glances,<br>
Among your gems Horror is not least fair;<br>
Murder, the dearest of your baubles, dances<br>
Upon your haughty breast with amorous air.<br>
</p>

<p>
Mothlike around your flame the transient, turning,<br>
Crackles and flames and cries, "Ah, heavenly doom!"<br>
The quivering lover o'er his mistress yearning<br>
Is but a dying man who woos his tomb.<br>
</p>

<p>
From heaven or the abyss? Let questioning be,<br>
O artless monster wreaking endless pain,<br>
So that your smile and glance throw wide to me<br>
An infinite that I have loved in vain.<br>
</p>

<p>
From Satan or from God? Holy or vile?<br>
Let questioning rest. O soft-eyed sprite, my queen,<br>
O rhythm, perfume, light &mdash; so you beguile<br>
Time from his slothfulness, the world from spleen.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Dorothy Martin, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: New Directions, 1955)

<b>Hymn to Beauty</b>
</p>

<p>
Be thou from Hell upsprung or Heaven descended,<br>
Beauty! thy look demoniac and divine<br>
Pours good and evil things confusedly blended,<br>
And therefore art thou likened unto wine.<br>
</p>

<p>
Thine eye with dawn is filled, with twilight dwindles,<br>
Like winds of night thou sprinklest perfumes mild;<br>
Thy kiss, that is a spell, the child's heart kindles,<br>
Thy mouth, a chalice, makes the man a child.<br>
</p>

<p>
Fallen from the stars or risen from gulfs of error,<br>
Fate dogs thy glamoured garments like a slave;<br>
With wanton hands thou scatterest joy and terror,<br>
And rulest over all, cold as the grave.<br>
</p>

<p>
Thou tramplest on the dead, scornful and cruel,<br>
Horror coils like an amulet round thine arms,<br>
Crime on thy superb bosom is a jewel<br>
That dances amorously among its charms.<br>
</p>

<p>
The dazzled moth that flies to thee, the candle,<br>
Shrivels and burns, blessing thy fatal flame;<br>
The lover that dies fawning o'er thy sandal<br>
Fondles his tomb and breathes the adored name.<br>
</p>

<p>
What if from Heaven or Hell thou com'st, immortal<br>
Beauty? O sphinx-like monster, since alone<br>
Thine eye, thy smile, thy hand opens the portal<br>
Of the Infinite I love and have not known.<br>
</p>

<p>
What if from God or Satan be the evangel?<br>
Thou my sole Queen! Witch of the velvet eyes!<br>
Since with thy fragrance, rhythm and light, O Angel!<br>
In a less hideous world time swiftlier flies.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; W. J. Robertson, from <i>Baudelaire: His Prose and Poetry</i>, edited by Thomas Robert Smith (New York: Boni and Liveright, 1919)

<p>
<b>Hymn to Beauty</b>
</p>

<p>
O Beauty! dost thou generate from Heaven or from Hell? <br>
Within thy glance, so diabolic and divine, <br>
Confusedly both wickedness and goodness dwell, <br>
And hence one might compare thee unto sparkling wine. <br>
</p>

<p>
Thy look containeth both the dawn and sunset stars, <br>
Thy perfumes, as upon a sultry night exhale, <br>
Thy kiss a philter, and thy mouth a Grecian vase, <br>
That renders heroes cowardly and infants hale. <br>
</p>

<p>
Yea, art thou from the planets, or the fiery womb? <br>
The demon follows in thy train, with magic fraught, <br>
Thou scatter'st seeds haphazardly of joy and doom, <br>
Thou govern'st everything, but answer'st unto nought. <br>
</p>

<p>
O Loveliness! thou spurnest corpses with delight, <br>
Among thy jewels, Horror hath such charms for thee, <br>
And Murder 'mid thy mostly cherished trinklets bright, <br>
Upon thy massive bosom dances amorously. <br>
</p>

<p>
The blinded, fluttering moth towards the candle flies, <br>
Then frizzles, falls, and falters &mdash; "Blessings unto thee"&mdash;<br>
The panting swain that o'er his beauteous mistress sighs, <br>
Seems like the Sick, that stroke their gravestones lovingly. <br>
</p>

<p>
What matter, if thou comest from the Heavens or Hell, <br>
O Beauty, frightful ghoul, ingenuous and obscure! <br>
So long thine eyes, thy smile, to me the way can tell <br>
Towards that Infinite I love, but never saw. <br>
</p>

<p>
From God or Satan? Angel, Mermaid, Proserpine? <br>
What matter if thou makest &mdash; blithe, voluptuous sprite &mdash;<br>
With rhythms, perfumes, visions &mdash; O mine only queen! &mdash;<br>
The universe less hideous and the hours less trite. <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Cyril Scott, <i>Baudelaire: The Flowers of Evil</i> (London: Elkin Mathews, 1909)
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Hymn to Beauty</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Comest thou from high heaven or from the abyss, <br>
O Beauty? For thy look, hellish, divine, <br>
Is fraught with mingled misery and bliss <br>
(Wherefore thy soul is as the soul of wine). <br>
</p>

<p>
Within thine eye red dawn and sunset burn; <br>
Odours thou spread'st as stormy evenings; <br>
Thy kisses are a draught, thy mouth an urn <br>
To make men quail and babes do mighty things. <br>
</p>

<p>
From the dark gulf, or from the immortal stars? <br>
The charmed Demon follows like a hound; <br>
Thou rul'st with hand that careless makes or mars, <br>
Nor to our prayers vouchsafest any sound. <br>
</p>

<p>
Thou walkest over dead men, mocking them, <br>
Beauty! and horror decks the throat of thee. <br>
And glittering murder, thy most precious gem, <br>
On thy proud belly dances amorously. <br>
</p>

<p>
Toward thee, flame, the dazzled insect flies. <br>
Shrivels and cries, "Blest conqueror of gloom!"<br>
Upon his fair one's breast the lover lies, <br>
As 'twere a dying man who hugs his tomb. <br>
</p>

<p>
Naive, terrible form! what boots it sky or pit, <br>
O beauty! if thine eye, smile, foot, alone <br>
Can open me the gate of an infinite <br>
My soul's athirst for, and has never known? <br>
</p>

<p>
What boots it, seraph or siren, from God's height <br>
Or Satan's hell, O queen! if thou dost come <br>
Soft-eyed, to make, with rhythm, scent, and light, <br>
The world less dull and time less burdensome? <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jack Collings Squire, <i>Poems and Baudelaire Flowers</i> (London: The New Age Press, Ltd, 1909)<br>
