<b>Le Jeu</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Dans des fauteuils fan&eacute;s des courtisanes vieilles,<br>
P&acirc;les, le sourcil peint, l'oeil c&acirc;lin et fatal,<br>
Minaudant, et faisant de leurs maigres oreilles<br>
Tomber un cliquetis de pierre et de m&eacute;tal;<br>
</p>

<p>
Autour des verts tapis des visages sans l&egrave;vre,<br>
Des l&egrave;vres sans couleur, des m&acirc;choires sans dent,<br>
Et des doigts convuls&eacute;s d'une infernale fi&egrave;vre,<br>
Fouillant la poche vide ou le sein palpitant;<br>
</p>

<p>
Sous de sales plafonds un rang de p&acirc;les lustres<br>
Et d'&eacute;normes quinquets projetant leurs lueurs<br>
Sur des fronts t&eacute;n&eacute;breux de po&egrave;tes illustres<br>
Qui viennent gaspiller leurs sanglantes sueurs;<br>
</p>

<p>
Voil&agrave; le noir tableau qu'en un r&ecirc;ve nocturne<br>
Je vis se d&eacute;rouler sous mon oeil clairvoyant.<br>
Moi-m&ecirc;me, dans un coin de l'antre taciturne,<br>
Je me vis accoud&eacute;, froid, muet, enviant,<br>
</p>

<p>
Enviant de ces gens la passion tenace,<br>
De ces vieilles putains la fun&egrave;bre gaiet&eacute;,<br>
Et tous gaillardement trafiquant &agrave; ma face,<br>
L'un de son vieil honneur, l'autre de sa beaut&eacute;!<br>
</p>

<p>
Et mon coeur s'effraya d'envier maint pauvre homme<br>
Courant avec ferveur &agrave; l'ab&icirc;me b&eacute;ant,<br>
Et qui, so&ucirc;l de son sang, pr&eacute;f&eacute;rerait en somme<br>
La douleur &agrave; la mort et l'enfer au n&eacute;ant!<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>Gambling</b><br>
</p>

<p>
In faded armchairs aged courtesans, <br>
Pale, eyebrows penciled, with alluring fatal eyes, <br>
Smirking and sending forth from wizened ears <br>
A jingling sound of metal and of gems;<br>
</p>

<p>
Around the gaming tables faces without lips, <br>
Lips without color and jaws without teeth, <br>
Fingers convulsed with a hellborn fever <br>
Searching empty pockets and fluttering bosoms;<br>
</p>

<p>
Under dirty ceilings a row of bright lusters <br>
And enormous oil-lamps casting their rays <br>
On the tenebrous brows of distinguished poets <br>
Who come there to squander the blood they have sweated;<br>
</p>

<p>
That is the black picture that in a dream one night<br>
I saw unfold before my penetrating eyes.<br>
I saw myself at the back of that quiet den,<br>
Leaning on my elbows, cold, silent, envying,<br>
</p>

<p>
Envying the stubborn passion of those people, <br>
The dismal merriment of those old prostitutes, <br>
All blithely selling right before my eyes, <br>
One his ancient honor, another her beauty!<br>
</p>

<p>
My heart took fright at its envy of so many <br>
Wretches running fiercely to the yawning chasm, <br>
Who, drunk with their own blood, would prefer, in a word, <br>
Suffering to death and hell to nothingness!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Gamblers</b>
</p>

<p>
In faded armchairs, harlots of past years <br>
Pale, with false eyebrows, wheedling, fatal eyes, <br>
And weird, affected airs, clink from thin ears <br>
A feeble sound, where tin with crystal vies.<br>
</p>

<p>
Round the green tables, faces without lips,<br>
Lips without colour, jaws their teeth surviving,<br>
And fingers which a hellish fever grips<br>
Convulsively in breasts and pockets diving<br>
</p>

<p>
Under the dirty ceiling, lustres flame <br>
And chandeliers, that blaze without remittance <br>
On shady brows of poets dear to fame, <br>
Who come to waste their sorely-sweated pittance.<br>
</p>

<p>
Such was the picture, in nocturnal dreaming, <br>
I saw unfurled to my clairvoyant eye. <br>
In that grim vault, one form on elbows leaning,<br>
Unspeaking, cold, and envious &mdash; was I! &mdash; <br>
</p>

<p>
Yes! envying, for their all-tenacious passion, <br>
These raddled tarts in their funereal glee, <br>
Who trafficked there, in such a merry fashion, <br>
Dead virtue and lost beauty on the spree.<br>
</p>

<p>
My heart was chilled with fear at envying<br>
Wretches who, headlong, rush to be destroyed,<br>
And, drunk with their own blood, seek anything &mdash; <br>
Hell, death, or torture &mdash; rather than the Void!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>


<p>
<b>The Gaming Room</b><br>
</p>

<p>
The armchairs of worn satin; the aged courtesans, <br>
Livid and rouged, their eyes relentless, their eyebrows blacked, <br>
Jingling eternally from their withered ears, to attract <br>
Attention, their huge earrings, and ogling behind their fans;<br>
</p>

<p>
The long green table, the rows of lipless faces, the lips <br>
Drained of all color; the gaping, toothless mouths; the unrest <br>
Of hundreds of white nervous fingers, stacking the chips, <br>
Or searching the empty pocket, the convulsive breast;<br>
</p>

<p>
The dirty ceiling, the blaze of crystal chandeliers, <br>
The low-hung lamps illumining with a crude glare <br>
The ravaged brows of poets, the scars of grenadiers, <br>
Who come to risk the earnings of their lifeblood there.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Such is the lurid spectacle that with calm dread<br>
I saw as in a melancholy dream unroll:<br>
Myself, too, sitting in a deserted corner, my head<br>
Propped in my hands, mute, weary, jealous to my soul,<br>
</p>

<p>
Jealous of all that rabble, of the lust of it, <br>
The terrible gaiety of those old whores, the smell <br>
And noise of life, for which they frantically sell <br>
Some remnant of their honor, their beauty, or their wit.<br>
</p>

<p>
And suddenly I was affrighted at my own heart, to feel<br>
Such envy of all men running wildly and out of breath<br>
Nowhere, and who prefer, like those around that wheel,<br>
Pain, horror, crime, insanity &mdash; anything &mdash; to death!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; George Dillon, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Gaming Table</b> <br>
</p>

<p>
The rich old ones quiver in their chairs<br>
Eyes uniformly sly under their blue and purple eyelids.<br>
They mince up and parcel out the conversation in <br>
Little packets that taint the atmosphere.<br>
</p>

<p>
Many fingers are already in their pockets of delirium<br>
Around the green felt table. The dentures clatter, loud<br>
Bets are placed from the lipless faces showing up somewhere<br>
Where if your neighbor couldn't hear you he can see what was said.<br>
</p>

<p>
So the chandeliers and the discolored wallpaper pick out<br>
The colors the guests are wearing companionably.<br>
I'm looking around the place quietly <br>
Since this Is the first time I've been invited<br>
</p>

<p>
Catch me in the corner where I'm watching enviously.<br>
I envy these creatures their tenacious lust.<br>
Skeletons that rattle mirthfully when they<br>
Recall those friends already underground <br>
After decades of pursuing pleasure.<br>
</p>

<p>
Envy, despicable word.<br>
Those here are drunk with <br>
The passion of their slow destruction<br>
Preferring agony to death <br>
And hell to nothingness.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Will Schmitz<br>
</p>

<br>

<b>The Gaming Table</b>

<p>
On tarnished chairs the pale old harlots quiver,<br>
Sly fatal eyes under the eyebrows painted<br>
Dreadfully mincingÂ : as their lean ears shiver<br>
With hateful jewelled peal the air is tainted.<br>
</p>

<p>
Round the green tables a frieze of lipless faces,<br>
Of blue-cold lips, if lips, of toothless gums,<br>
And fingers, fevered with Hell's last disgraces,<br>
Fumbling in pockets &mdash; or in deliriums.<br>
</p>

<p>
Dull chandeliers in the soot-mottled ceiling<br>
And swollen lamps pick out with violet<br>
Shadow the brows of famous poets, reeling<br>
To waste the guerdon of art's blood-stained sweat.<br>
</p>

<p>
My eye, turned inward, darkly can discern<br>
This Hellish picture self-distorted thus,<br>
The while I see in yonder taciturn<br>
Corner myself, cold, mute &mdash; and envious.<br>
</p>

<p>
Envying these creatures their tenacious lust,<br>
These rattling skeletons their deadly mirth,<br>
Envying all of those who gaily thrust<br>
Honour or beauty to rot beneath the earth.<br>
</p>

<p>
Envious, my heart! O dark and dreadful word!<br>
When these with passion their bright destruction bless,<br>
Who, drunk with the pulse of their own blood, preferred<br>
Deep pain to death and Hell to nothingness.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Humbert Wolfe, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: New Directions, 1955)
