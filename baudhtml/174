<b>Tristesses de la lune</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Ce soir, la lune r&ecirc;ve avec plus de paresse;<br>
Ainsi qu'une beaut&eacute;, sur de nombreux coussins,<br>
Qui d'une main distraite et l&eacute;g&egrave;re caresse<br>
Avant de s'endormir le contour de ses seins,<br>
</p>

<p>
Sur le dos satin&eacute; des molles avalanches,<br>
Mourante, elle se livre aux longues p&acirc;moisons,<br>
Et prom&egrave;ne ses yeux sur les visions blanches<br>
Qui montent dans l'azur comme des floraisons.<br>
</p>

<p>
Quand parfois sur ce globe, en sa langueur oisive,<br>
Elle laisse filer une larme furtive,<br>
Un po&egrave;te pieux, ennemi du sommeil,<br>
</p>

<p>
Dans le creux de sa main prend cette larme p&acirc;le,<br>
Aux reflets iris&eacute;s comme un fragment d'opale,<br>
Et la met dans son coeur loin des yeux du soleil.<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>Sadness of the Moon</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Tonight the moon dreams with more indolence, <br>
Like a lovely woman on a bed of cushions <br>
Who fondles with a light and listless hand <br>
The contour of her breasts before falling asleep;<br>
</p>

<p>
On the satiny back of the billowing clouds,<br>
Languishing, she lets herself fall into long swoons <br>
And casts her eyes over the white phantoms <br>
That rise in the azure like blossoming flowers.<br>
</p>

<p>
When, in her lazy listlessness,<br>
She sometimes sheds a furtive tear upon this globe,<br>
A pious poet, enemy of sleep,<br>
</p>

<p>
In the hollow of his hand catches this pale tear, <br>
With the iridescent reflections of opal, <br>
And hides it in his heart afar from the sun's eyes.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Sorrow of the Moon</b>
</p>

<p>
More drowsy dreams the moon tonight. She rests <br>
Like a proud beauty on heaped cushions pressing, <br>
With light and absent-minded touch caressing, <br>
Before she sleeps, the contour of her breasts.<br>
</p>

<p>
On satin-shimmering, downy avalanches <br>
She dies from swoon to swoon in languid change, <br>
And lets her eyes on snowy visions range <br>
That in the azure rise like flowering branches.<br>
</p>

<p>
When sometimes to this earth her languor calm<br>
Lets streak a stealthy tear, a pious poet,<br>
The enemy of sleep, in his cupped palm,<br>
</p>

<p>
Takes this pale tear, of liquid opal spun <br>
With rainbow lights, deep in his heart to stow it <br>
Far from the staring eyeballs of the Sun.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>


<p>
<b>The Sadness of the Moon</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Tonight the moon, by languorous memories obsessed, <br>
Lies pensive and awake: a sleepless beauty amid <br>
The tossed and multitudinous cushions of her bed, <br>
Caressing with an abstracted hand the curve of her breast.<br>
</p>

<p>
Surrendered to her deep sadness as to a lover, for hours <br>
She lolls in the bright luxurious disarray of the sky &mdash; <br>
Haggard, entranced &mdash; and watches the small clouds float by <br>
Uncurling indolently in the blue air like flowers.<br>
</p>

<p>
When now and then upon this planet she lets fall,<br>
Out of her idleness and sorrow, a secret tear,<br>
Some poet &mdash; an enemy of slumber, musing apart &mdash; <br>
</p>

<p>
Catches in his cupped hands the unearthly tribute, all <br>
Fiery and iridescent like an opal's sphere, <br>
And hides it from the sun for ever in his heart.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; George Dillon, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Tristesses de la lune</b><br>
</p>

<p>
the moon tonight, more indolently dreaming,<br>
as on a pillowed bed, a woman seems,<br>
caressing with a hand distraught and gleaming,<br>
her soft curved bosom, ere she sinks in dreams.<br>
</p>

<p>
against a snowy satin avalanche<br>
she lies entranced and drowned in swooning hours,<br>
her gaze upon the visions born to blanch<br>
those far blue depths with ever-blossoming flowers.<br>
</p>

<p>
and when in some soft languorous interval,<br>
earthward, she lets a stealthy tear-drop fall,<br>
a poet, foe to slumber, toiling on,<br>
</p>

<p>
with reverent hollow hand receives the pearl,<br>
where shimmering opalescences unfurl,<br>
and shields it in his heart, far from the sun.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Lewis Piaget Shanks, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (New York: Ives Washburn, 1931)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Sadness of the Moon-Goddess</b>
</p>

<p>
To-night the Moon dreams with increased weariness, <br>
Like a beauty stretched forth on a downy heap <br>
Of rugs, while her languorous fingers caress <br>
The contour of her breasts, before falling to sleep. <br>
</p>

<p>
On the satin back of the avalanche soft, <br>
She falls into lingering swoons, as she dies, <br>
While she lifteth her eyes to white visions aloft, <br>
Which like efflorescence float up to the skies. <br>
</p>

<p>
When at times, in her languor, down on to this sphere, <br>
She slyly lets trickle a furtive tear, <br>
A poet, desiring slumber to shun, <br>
</p>

<p>
Takes up this pale tear in the palm of his hand <br>
(The colours of which like an opal blend), <br>
And buries it far from the eyes of the sun. <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Cyril Scott, <i>Baudelaire: The Flowers of Evil</i> (London: Elkin Mathews, 1909)
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Sadness of the Moon</b><br>
</p>

<p>
This evening the Moon dreams more languidly, <br>
Like a beauty who on many cushions rests, <br>
And with her light hand fondles lingeringly, <br>
Before she sleeps, the slope of her sweet breasts. <br>
</p>

<p>
On her soft satined avalanches' height <br>
Dying, she laps herself for hours and hours <br>
In long, long swoons, and gazes at the white <br>
Visions which rise athwart the blue-like flowers. <br>
</p>

<p>
When sometimes in her perfect indolence <br>
She lets a furtive tear steal gently thence. <br>
Some pious poet, a lone, sleepless one, <br>
</p>

<p>
Takes in his hollowed hand this gem, shot through, <br>
Like an opal stone, with gleams of every hue, <br>
And in his heart's depths hides it from the sun. <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jack Collings Squire, <i>Poems and Baudelaire Flowers</i> (London: The New Age Press, Ltd, 1909)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Sadness of the Moon</b>
</p>

<p>
The Moon more indolently dreams to-night<br>
Than a fair woman on her couch at rest,<br>
Caressing, with a hand distraught and light,<br>
Before she sleeps, the contour of her breast.<br>
</p>

<p>
Upon her silken avalanche of down,<br>
Dying she breathes a long and swooning sigh;<br>
And watches the white visions past her flown,<br>
Which rise like blossoms to the azure sky.<br>
</p>

<p>
And when, at times, wrapped in her languor deep,<br>
Earthward she lets a furtive tear-drop flow,<br>
Some pious poet, enemy of sleep,<br>
</p>

<p>
Takes in his hollow hand the tear of snow<br>
Whence gleams of iris and of opal start,<br>
And hides it from the Sun, deep in his heart.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; F.P. Sturm, from <i>Baudelaire: His Prose and Poetry</i>, edited by Thomas Robert Smith (New York: Boni and Liveright, 1919)

Two editions of <i>Fleurs du mal</i> were published in Baudelaire's lifetime &mdash; one in 1857 and an expanded edition in 1861. "Scraps" and censored poems were collected in <i>Les &Eacute;paves</i> in 1866. After Baudelaire died the following year, a "definitive" edition appeared in 1868.
