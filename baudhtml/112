<b>Boh&eacute;miens en voyage</b><br>
</p>

<p>
La tribu proph&eacute;tique aux prunelles ardentes<br>
Hier s'est mise en route, emportant ses petits<br>
Sur son dos, ou livrant &agrave; leurs fiers app&eacute;tits<br>
Le tr&eacute;sor toujours pr&ecirc;t des mamelles pendantes.<br>
</p>

<p>
Les hommes vont &agrave; pied sous leurs armes luisantes<br>
Le long des chariots o&ugrave; les leurs sont blottis,<br>
Promenant sur le ciel des yeux appesantis<br>
Par le morne regret des chim&egrave;res absentes.<br>
</p>

<p>
Du fond de son r&eacute;duit sablonneux, le grillon,<br>
Les regardant passer, redouble sa chanson;<br>
Cyb&egrave;le, qui les aime, augmente ses verdures,<br>
</p>

<p>
Fait couler le rocher et fleurir le d&eacute;sert<br>
Devant ces voyageurs, pour lesquels est ouvert<br>
L'empire familier des t&eacute;n&egrave;bres futures.<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>Gypsies Traveling</b><br>
</p>

<p>
The prophetical tribe, that ardent eyed people, <br>
Set out last night, carrying their children <br>
On their backs, or yielding to those fierce appetites <br>
The ever ready treasure of pendulous breasts.<br>
</p>

<p>
The men travel on foot with their gleaming weapons <br>
Alongside the wagons where their kin are huddled, <br>
Surveying the heavens with eyes rendered heavy <br>
By a mournful regret for vanished illusions.<br>
</p>

<p>
The cricket from the depths of his sandy retreat <br>
Watches them as they pass, and louder grows his song; <br>
Cybele, who loves them, increases her verdure,<br>
</p>

<p>
Makes the desert blossom, water spurt from the rock <br>
Before these travelers for whom is opened wide <br>
The familiar domain of the future's darkness.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Gipsies on the Road</b>
</p>

<p>
The tribe of seers, last night, began its march <br>
With burning eyes, and shouldering its young <br>
To whose ferocious appetites it swung <br>
The wealth of hanging breasts that nought can parch.<br>
</p>

<p>
The men, their weapons glinting in the rays, <br>
Walk by the convoy where their folks are carted, <br>
Sweeping the far-off skylines with a gaze <br>
Regretful of Chimeras long-departed.<br>
</p>

<p>
Out of his hole the cricket sees them pass<br>
And sings the louder. Greener grows the grass<br>
Because Cybele loves them, and has made<br>
</p>

<p>
The barren rock to gush, the sands to flower, <br>
To greet these travellers, before whose power <br>
Familiar futures open realms of shade.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>


<p>
<b>The Gypsies</b><br>
</p>

<p>
They set out yesterday, the tribe of ragged seers <br>
With burning eyes &mdash; bearing their little ones in nests <br>
Upon their backs, or giving them, to stop their tears, <br>
The teats of inexhaustible and swarthy breasts.<br>
</p>

<p>
The men walk shouldering their rifles silently <br>
Beside the hooded wagons with bright tatters hung, <br>
And peer into the sky, as if they hoped to see <br>
Some old mirage that beckoned them when they were young.<br>
</p>

<p>
No matter where they journey through the meager land, <br>
The cricket will sing louder from his lair of sand, <br>
And Cybele, who loves them, will smile where they advance:<br>
</p>

<p>
The desert will be fruitful, the arid rock will flow <br>
Before the footsteps of these wayfarers, who go <br>
Eternally into the lightless realm of chance.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; George Dillon, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Gypsies Travelling</b>
</p>

<p>
The tribe prophetic with the eyes of fire<br>
Went forth last night; their little ones at rest<br>
Each on his mother's back, with his desire<br>
Set on the ready treasure of her breast.<br>
</p>

<p>
Laden with shining arms the men-folk tread<br>
By the long wagons where their goods lie hidden;<br>
They watch the heaven with eyes grown weariÃ«d<br>
Of hopeless dreams that come to them unbidden.<br>
</p>

<p>
The grasshopper, from out his sandy screen,<br>
Watching them pass redoubles his shrill song;<br>
Dian, who loves them, makes the grass more green,<br>
</p>

<p>
And makes the rock run water for this throng<br>
Of ever-wandering ones Whose calm eyes see<br>
Familiar realms of darkness yet to be.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; F.P. Sturm, from <i>Baudelaire: His Prose and Poetry</i>, edited by Thomas Robert Smith (New York: Boni and Liveright, 1919)

Two editions of <i>Fleurs du mal</i> were published in Baudelaire's lifetime &mdash; one in 1857 and an expanded edition in 1861. "Scraps" and censored poems were collected in <i>Les &Eacute;paves</i> in 1866. After Baudelaire died the following year, a "definitive" edition appeared in 1868.
