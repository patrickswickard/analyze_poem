<b>Au Lecteur</b>
</p>

<p>
La sottise, l'erreur, le p&eacute;ch&eacute;, la l&eacute;sine,<br>
Occupent nos esprits et travaillent nos corps,<br>
Et nous alimentons nos aimables remords,<br>
Comme les mendiants nourrissent leur vermine.<br>
</p>

<p>
Nos p&eacute;ch&eacute;s sont t&ecirc;tus, nos repentirs sont l&acirc;ches;<br>
Nous nous faisons payer grassement nos aveux,<br>
Et nous rentrons gaiement dans le chemin bourbeux,<br>
Croyant par de vils pleurs laver toutes nos taches.<br>
</p>

<p>
Sur l'oreiller du mal c'est Satan Trism&eacute;giste<br>
Qui berce longuement notre esprit enchant&eacute;,<br>
Et le riche m&eacute;tal de notre volont&eacute;<br>
Est tout vaporis&eacute; par ce savant chimiste.<br>
</p>

<p>
C'est le Diable qui tient les fils qui nous remuent!<br>
Aux objets r&eacute;pugnants nous trouvons des appas;<br>
Chaque jour vers l'Enfer nous descendons d'un pas,<br>
Sans horreur, &agrave; travers des t&eacute;n&egrave;bres qui puent.<br>
</p>

<p>
Ainsi qu'un d&eacute;bauch&eacute; pauvre qui baise et mange<br>
Le sein martyris&eacute; d'une antique catin,<br>
Nous volons au passage un plaisir clandestin<br>
Que nous pressons bien fort comme une vieille orange.<br>
</p>

<p>
Serr&eacute;, fourmillant, comme un million d'helminthes,<br>
Dans nos cerveaux ribote un peuple de D&eacute;mons,<br>
Et, quand nous respirons, la Mort dans nos poumons<br>
Descend, fleuve invisible, avec de sourdes plaintes.<br>
</p>

<p>
Si le viol, le poison, le poignard, l'incendie,<br>
N'ont pas encor brod&eacute; de leurs plaisants dessins<br>
Le canevas banal de nos piteux destins,<br>
C'est que notre &acirc;me, h&eacute;las! n'est pas assez hardie.<br>
</p>

<p>
Mais parmi les chacals, les panth&egrave;res, les lices,<br>
Les singes, les scorpions, les vautours, les serpents,<br>
Les monstres glapissants, hurlants, grognants, rampants,<br>
Dans la m&eacute;nagerie inf&acirc;me de nos vices,<br>
</p>

<p>
II en est un plus laid, plus m&eacute;chant, plus immonde!<br>
Quoiqu'il ne pousse ni grands gestes ni grands cris,<br>
Il ferait volontiers de la terre un d&eacute;bris<br>
Et dans un b&acirc;illement avalerait le monde;<br>
</p>

<p>
C'est l'Ennui! L'oeil charg&eacute; d'un pleur involontaire,<br>
II r&ecirc;ve d'&eacute;chafauds en fumant son houka.<br>
Tu le connais, lecteur, ce monstre d&eacute;licat,<br>
&mdash; Hypocrite lecteur, &mdash; mon semblable, &mdash; mon fr&egrave;re!<br>
</p>

<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>To the Reader</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Folly, error, sin, avarice <br>
Occupy our minds and labor our bodies, <br>
And we feed our pleasant remorse <br>
As beggars nourish their vermin.<br>
</p>

<p>
Our sins are obstinate, our repentance is faint; <br>
We exact a high price for our confessions, <br>
And we gaily return to the miry path, <br>
Believing that base tears wash away all our stains.<br>
</p>

<p>
On the pillow of evil Satan, Trismegist, <br>
Incessantly lulls our enchanted minds, <br>
And the noble metal of our will <br>
Is wholly vaporized by this wise alchemist.<br>
</p>

<p>
The Devil holds the strings which move us! <br>
In repugnant things we discover charms; <br>
Every day we descend a step further toward Hell, <br>
Without horror, through gloom that stinks.<br>
</p>

<p>
Like a penniless rake who with kisses and bites <br>
Tortures the breast of an old prostitute, <br>
We steal as we pass by a clandestine pleasure <br>
That we squeeze very hard like a dried up orange.<br>
</p>

<p>
Serried, swarming, like a million maggots, <br>
A legion of Demons carouses in our brains, <br>
And when we breathe, Death, that unseen river, <br>
Descends into our lungs with muffled wails.<br>
</p>

<p>
If rape, poison, daggers, arson <br>
Have not yet embroidered with their pleasing designs <br>
The banal canvas of our pitiable lives, <br>
It is because our souls have not enough boldness.<br>
</p>

<p>
But among the jackals, the panthers, the bitch hounds,<br>
The apes, the scorpions, the vultures, the serpents,<br>
The yelping, howling, growling, crawling monsters,<br>
In the filthy menagerie of our vices,<br>
</p>

<p>
There is one more ugly, more wicked, more filthy! <br>
Although he makes neither great gestures nor great cries, <br>
He would willingly make of the earth a shambles <br>
And, in a yawn, swallow the world;<br>
</p>

<p>
He is Ennui! &mdash; His eye watery as though with tears, <br>
He dreams of scaffolds as he smokes his hookah pipe.<br>
You know him reader, that refined monster,<br>
&mdash; Hypocritish reader, &mdash; my fellow, &mdash; my brother!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>To the Reader</b>
</p>

<p>
Folly and error, avarice and vice, <br>
Employ our souls and waste our bodies' force. <br>
As mangey beggars incubate their lice, <br>
We nourish our innocuous remorse.<br>
</p>

<p>
Our sins are stubborn, craven our repentance. <br>
For our weak vows we ask excessive prices. <br>
Trusting our tears will wash away the sentence, <br>
We sneak off where the muddy road entices.<br>
</p>

<p>
Cradled in evil, that Thrice-Great Magician, <br>
The Devil, rocks our souls, that can't resist; <br>
And the rich metal of our own volition <br>
Is vaporised by that sage alchemist.<br>
</p>

<p>
The Devil pulls the strings by which we're worked: <br>
By all revolting objects lured, we slink <br>
Hellwards; each day down one more step we're jerked <br>
Feeling no horror, through the shades that stink.<br>
</p>

<p>
Just as a lustful pauper bites and kisses <br>
The scarred and shrivelled breast of an old whore, <br>
We steal, along the roadside, furtive blisses, <br>
Squeezing them, like stale oranges, for more.<br>
</p>

<p>
Packed tight, like hives of maggots, thickly seething<br>
Within our brains a host of demons surges. <br>
Deep down into our lungs at every breathing, <br>
Death flows, an unseen river, moaning dirges.<br>
</p>

<p>
If rape or arson, poison, or the knife <br>
Has wove no pleasing patterns in the stuff <br>
Of this drab canvas we accept as life &mdash; <br>
It is because we are not bold enough!<br>
</p>

<p>
Amongst the jackals, leopards, mongrels, apes, <br>
Snakes, scorpions, vultures, that with hellish din, <br>
Squeal, roar, writhe, gambol, crawl, with monstrous shapes, <br>
In each man's foul menagerie of sin &mdash; <br>
</p>

<p>
There's one more damned than all. He never gambols,<br>
Nor crawls, nor roars, but, from the rest withdrawn,<br>
Gladly of this whole earth would make a shambles<br>
And swallow up existence with a yawn...<br>
</p>

<p>
Boredom! He smokes his hookah, while he dreams <br>
Of gibbets, weeping tears he cannot smother. <br>
You know this dainty monster, too, it seems &mdash; <br>
Hypocrite reader! &mdash; You! &mdash; My twin! &mdash; My brother!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>

<p>
<b>To the Reader</b>
</p>

<p>
Folly, error, sin and avarice<br>
Occupy our minds and waste our bodies,<br>
And we feed our polite remorse<br>
As beggars feed their lice.<br>
</p>

<p>
Our sins are stubborn, our repentance is cowardly;<br>
We ask high prices for our vows,<br>
And we gaily return to the muddy road,<br>
Believing we will wash away all our spots with vile tears.<br>
</p>

<p>
On the pillow of evil it is Thrice-Great Satan<br>
Who endlessly rocks our bewitched mind,<br>
And the rich metal of our will<br>
Is vaporized by that wise chemist.<br>
</p>

<p>
It is the Devil who pulls the strings that move us!<br>
In repulsive objects we find enticing lures;<br>
Each day we go down one more step toward Hell,<br>
Without horror, through the darkness which smells rank.<br>
</p>

<p>
Just as a lustful pauper who kisses and bites<br>
The martyred breast of an aged whore,<br>
We steal, as we move along, a clandestine pleasure<br>
Which we squeeze hard like an old orange.<br>
</p>

<p>
Packed tight and swarming like a million maggots,<br>
A crowd of Demons carouse in our brains,<br>
And, when we breathe, Death into our lungs<br>
Descends, an invisible river, with heavy wailings.<br>
</p>

<p>
If rape, poison, the knife and arson<br>
Have not yet woven with their pleasing patterns<br>
The banal canvas of our pitiful fate,<br>
It is because our soul, alas, is not bold enough.<br>
</p>

<p>
But among the jackals, panthers, bitches,<br>
Monkeys, scorpions, vultures, serpents,<br>
The monsters squealing, yelling, grunting, crawling<br>
In the infamous menagerie of our vices<br>
</p>

<p>
There is one uglier, more wicked and more foul than all!<br>
Although he does not make great gestures or great cries,<br>
He would gladly make the earth a shambles<br>
And swallow the world in a yawn;<br>
</p>

<p>
It is boredom! his eyes weeping an involuntary tear,<br>
He dreams of gibbets as he smokes his hookah.<br>
You know him, reader, this delicate monster,<br>
&mdash; Hypocrite reader &mdash; my twin &mdash; my brother!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Wallace Fowlie, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (New York: Dover Publications, 1964)<br>

<br>

<p>
<b>To the Reader</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Folly and error, sin and avarice, <br>
Labor our minds and bodies in their course, <br>
Blithely we nourish pleasurable remorse <br>
As beggars feed their parasitic lice.<br>
</p>

<p>
Our sins are stubborn, our repentance faint, <br>
We sell our weak confessions at high price, <br>
Returning gaily to the bogs of vice, <br>
Thinking base tears can cleanse our every taint.<br>
</p>

<p>
Pillowed on evil, Satan Trismegist <br>
Ceaselessly cradles our enchanted mind, <br>
The flawless metal of our will we find <br>
Volatilized by this rare alchemist.<br>
</p>

<p>
The Devil holds the puppet threads; and swayed <br>
By noisome things and their repugnant spell, <br>
Daily we take one further step toward Hell, <br>
Suffering no horror in the olid shade.<br>
</p>

<p>
As an impoverished rake will kiss and bite <br>
The bruised blue nipples of an ancient whore, <br>
We steal clandestine pleasures by the score, <br>
Which, like dried orange rinds, we pressure tight.<br>
</p>

<p>
Serried, aswarm, like million maggots, so<br>
Demons carouse in us with fetid breath, <br>
And, when we breathe, the unseen stream of death <br>
Flows down our lungs with muffled wads of woe.<br>
</p>

<p>
If poison, knife, rape, arson, have not dared <br>
Yet stamp the pleasing pattern of their gyves <br>
On the dull canvas of our sorry lives, <br>
It is because our torpid souls are scared.<br>
</p>

<p>
But side by side with our monstrosities &mdash; <br>
Jackals and bitch hounds, scorpions, vultures, apes,<br>
Panthers and serpents whose repulsive shapes<br>
Pollute our vice's dank menageries,<br>
</p>

<p>
There is one viler and more wicked spawn, <br>
Which never makes great gestures or loud cries <br>
Yet would turn earth to wastes of sumps and sties <br>
And swallow all creation in a yawn:<br>
</p>

<p>
Ennui! Moist-eyed perforce, worse than all other, <br>
Dreaming of stakes, he smokes his hookah pipe.<br>
Reader, you know this fiend, refined and ripe, <br>
Reader, O hypocrite &mdash; my like! &mdash; my brother!<br>

<p>
&mdash; Jacques LeClercq, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (Mt Vernon, NY: Peter Pauper Press, 1958)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>To the Reader</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Infatuation, sadism, lust, avarice<br>
possess our souls and drain the body's force;<br>
we spoonfeed our adorable remorse,<br>
like whores or beggars nourishing their lice.<br>
</p>

<p>
Our sins are mulish, our confessions lies;<br>
we play to the grandstand with our promises,<br>
we pray for tears to wash our filthiness;<br>
importantly pissing hogwash through our styes.<br>
</p>

<p>
The devil, watching by our sickbeds, hissed<br>
old smut and folk-songs to our soul, until<br>
the soft and precious metal of our will<br>
boiled off in vapor for this scientist.<br>
</p>

<p>
Each day his flattery makes us eat a toad,<br>
and each step forward is a step to hell,<br>
unmoved, through previous corpses and their smell<br>
asphyxiate our progress on this road.<br>
</p>

<p>
Like the poor lush who cannot satisfy,<br>
we try to force our sex with counterfeits,<br>
die drooling on the deliquescent tits,<br>
mouthing the rotten orange we suck dry.<br>
</p>

<p>
Gangs of demons are boozing in our brain &mdash;<br>
ranked, swarming, like a million warrior-ants,<br>
they drown and choke the cistern of our wants;<br>
each time we breathe, we tear our lungs with pain.<br>
</p>

<p>
If poison, arson, sex, narcotics, knives<br>
have not yet ruined us and stitched their quick,<br>
loud patterns on the canvas of our lives,<br>
it is because our souls are still too sick.<br>
</p>

<p>
Among the vermin, jackals, panthers, lice,<br>
gorillas and tarantulas that suck<br>
and snatch and scratch and defecate and fuck<br>
in the disorderly circus of our vice,<br>
</p>

<p>
there's one more ugly and abortive birth.<br>
It makes no gestures, never beats its breast,<br>
yet it would murder for a moment's rest,<br>
and willingly annihilate the earth.<br>
</p>

<p>
It's BOREDOM. Tears have glued its eyes together.<br>
You know it well, my Reader. This obscene<br>
beast chain-smokes yawning for the guillotine &mdash;<br>
you &mdash; hypocrite Reader &mdash; my double &mdash; my brother!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Robert Lowell, from Marthiel &amp; Jackson Matthews, eds., <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: New Directions, 1963)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Preface</b> <br>
</p>

<p>
Envy, sin, avarice & error<br>
These are friends we know already &mdash;<br>
Feeding them sentiment and regret<br>
I'd hoped they'd vanish.<br>
</p>

<p>
But wrongs are stubborn<br>
We have our records<br>
and tho it can be struggled with<br>
There's no soft way to a dollar.<br>
</p>

<p>
On the bedroom's pillows<br>
The leisure senses unravel.<br>
It's too hard to be unwilling<br>
When there's so little to amuse.<br>
</p>

<p>
The devil twists the strings on which we jerk!<br>
Objects and asses continue to attract us.<br>
Each day it's closer to the end<br>
Without butter on our sufferings' amends.<br>
</p>

<p>
Like some poor short-dicked scum<br>
Biting and kissing the scarred breast<br>
Of a whore who'd as soon<br>
Drive nails through his nuts<br>
We breath death into our skulls<br>
Afraid to let it go.<br>
</p>

<p>
If the drugs, sex, perversion and destruction<br>
Haven't made it to your suburb yet<br>
Graffitied your garage doors<br>
Of our common fate, don't worry.  <br>
</p>

<p>
If the short and long con<br>
Both ends against the middle<br>
Trick a fool<br>
Set the dummy up to fight<br>
And the other old dodges<br>
All howling to scream and crawl inside <br>
Haven't arrived broken you down<br>
</p>

<p>
It's because your boredom has kept them away.<br>
There's no act or cry<br>
That can take this world apart<br>
Snuff out its miserable contemplation<br>
</p>

<p>
Boredom! Our jailer. Starving or glutted<br>
By the executions? Smoke, desperate for a whiter lie,<br>
You, my easy reader, never satisfied lover.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Will Schmitz<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>To the Reader</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Foolishness, error, sin, niggardliness, <br>
Occupy our minds and work on our bodies, <br>
And we feed our mild remorse, <br>
As beggars nourish their vermin.<br>
</p>

<p>
Our sins are insistent, our repentings are limp;<br>
We pay ourselves richly for our admissions,<br>
And we gaily go once more on the filthy path<br>
Believing that by cheap fears we shall wash away all our sins.<br>
</p>

<p>
On the pillow of evil it is Satan Trismegistus<br>
Who soothes a long while our bewitched mind,<br>
And the rich metal of our determination<br>
Is made vapor by that learned chemist.<br>
</p>

<p>
It is the Devil who holds the reins which make us go!<br>
In repulsive objects we find something charming;<br>
Each day we take one more step towards Hell &mdash; <br>
Without being horrified &mdash;  across darknesses that stink.<br>
</p>

<p>
Like a beggarly sensualist who kisses and eats<br>
The martyred breast of an ancient strumpet, <br>
We steal where we may a furtive pleasure <br>
Which we handle forcefully like an old orange.<br>
</p>

<p>
Tight, swarming, like a million worms,<br>
A population of Demons carries on in our brains,<br>
And, when we breathe, Death into our lungs<br>
Goes down, an invisible river, with thick complaints.<br>
</p>

<p>
If rape, poison, the dagger, arson,<br>
Have not as yet embroidered with their pleasing designs<br>
The recurrent canvas of our pitiable destinies,<br>
It is that our spirit, alas, is not brave enough.<br>
</p>

<p>
But among the jackals, the panthers, the bitch-hounds, <br>
The apes, the scorpions, the vultures, the serpents, <br>
The monsters screeching, howling, grumbling, creeping,<br>
In the infamous menagerie of our vices,<br>
</p>

<p>
There is one uglier, wickeder, more shameless!<br>
Although he makes no large gestures nor loud cries<br>
He willingly would make rubbish of the earth<br>
And with a yawn swallow the world;<br>
</p>

<p>
He is Ennui! &mdash; His eye filled with an unwished-for tear,<br>
He dreams of scaffolds while puffing at his hookah.<br>
You know him, reader, this exquisite monster,<br>
&mdash; Hypocrite reader, &mdash; my likeness, &mdash; my brother!<br>
