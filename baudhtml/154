<b>Moesta et errabunda</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Dis-moi ton coeur parfois s'envole-t-il, Agathe,<br>
Loin du noir oc&eacute;an de l'immonde cit&eacute;<br>
Vers un autre oc&eacute;an o&ugrave; la splendeur &eacute;clate,<br>
Bleu, clair, profond, ainsi que la virginit&eacute;?<br>
Dis-moi, ton coeur parfois s'envole-t-il, Agathe?<br>
</p>

<p>
La mer, la vaste mer, console nos labeurs!<br>
Quel d&eacute;mon a dot&eacute; la mer, rauque chanteuse<br>
Qu'accompagne l'immense orgue des vents grondeurs,<br>
De cette fonction sublime de berceuse?<br>
La mer, la vaste mer, console nos labeurs!<br>
</p>

<p>
Emporte-moi wagon! enl&egrave;ve-moi, fr&eacute;gate!<br>
Loin! loin! ici la boue est faite de nos pleurs!<br>
&mdash; Est-il vrai que parfois le triste coeur d'Agathe<br>
Dise: Loin des remords, des crimes, des douleurs,<br>
Emporte-moi, wagon, enl&egrave;ve-moi, fr&eacute;gate?<br>
</p>

<p>
Comme vous &ecirc;tes loin, paradis parfum&eacute;,<br>
O&ugrave; sous un clair azur tout n'est qu'amour et joie,<br>
O&ugrave; tout ce que l'on aime est digne d'&ecirc;tre aim&eacute;,<br>
O&ugrave; dans la volupt&eacute; pure le coeur se noie!<br>
Comme vous &ecirc;tes loin, paradis parfum&eacute;!<br>
</p>

<p>
Mais le vert paradis des amours enfantines,<br>
Les courses, les chansons, les baisers, les bouquets,<br>
Les violons vibrant derri&egrave;re les collines,<br>
Avec les brocs de vin, le soir, dans les bosquets,<br>
&mdash; Mais le vert paradis des amours enfantines,<br>
</p>

<p>
L'innocent paradis, plein de plaisirs furtifs,<br>
Est-il d&eacute;j&agrave; plus loin que l'Inde et que la Chine?<br>
Peut-on le rappeler avec des cris plaintifs,<br>
Et l'animer encor d'une voix argentine,<br>
L'innocent paradis plein de plaisirs furtifs?<br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>Grieving and Wandering</b>
</p>

<p>
Tell me, does your heart sometimes fly away, Agatha, <br>
Far from the black ocean of the filthy city, <br>
Toward another ocean where splendor glitters, <br>
Blue, clear, profound, as is virginity? <br>
Tell me, does your heart sometimes fly away, Agatha?<br>
</p>

<p>
The sea, the boundless sea, consoles us for our toil!<br>
What demon endowed the sea, that raucous singer,<br>
Whose accompanist is the roaring wind,<br>
With the sublime function of cradle-rocker?<br>
The sea, the boundless sea, consoles us for our toil!<br>
</p>

<p>
Take me away, carriage! Carry me off, frigate! <br>
Far, far away! Here the mud is made with our tears!<br>
&mdash; Is it true that sometimes the sad heart of Agatha <br>
Says: Far from crimes, from remorse, from sorrow, <br>
Take me away, carriage, carry me off, frigate?<br>
</p>

<p>
How far away you are, O perfumed Paradise,<br>
Where under clear blue sky there's only love and joy,<br>
Where all that one loves is worthy of love,<br>
Where the heart is drowned in sheer enjoyment!<br>
How far away you are, O perfumed Paradise!<br>
</p>

<p>
But the green Paradise of childhood loves<br>
The outings, the singing, the kisses, the bouquets,<br>
The violins vibrating behind the hills,<br>
And the evenings in the woods, with jugs of wine<br>
&mdash; But the green Paradise of childhood loves,<br>
</p>

<p>
That sinless Paradise, full of furtive pleasures, <br>
Is it farther off now than India and China? <br>
Can one call it back with plaintive cries, <br>
And animate it still with a silvery voice, <br>
That sinless Paradise full of furtive pleasures?<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Moesta et Errabunda</b>
</p>

<p>
Agatha, does your heart rise up and fly, <br>
Far from the city's black and sordid sea <br>
Towards a sea that's blue as any sky, <br>
And clear and deep as pure virginity? <br>
Agatha, does your heart rise up and fly?<br>
</p>

<p>
The sea, the mighty sea, consoles our labour. <br>
What demon taught the sea with raucous verse <br>
To choir the organ which the winds belabour <br>
And lullaby our sorrows like a nurse? <br>
The sea, the mighty sea, consoles our labour.<br>
</p>

<p>
Train, bear me; take me, ship, to other climes! <br>
Far, far! For here the mud is made of tears.<br>
&mdash; Does Agatha's sad heart not say, at times, <br>
"Far from remorses, sorrows, crimes, and fears, <br>
Train, bear me; take me, ship, to other climes"?<br>
</p>

<p>
How distant is that perfumed paradise! <br>
Where all is joy and love with azure crowned, <br>
Where all one loves is truly worth the price, <br>
And hearts in pure voluptuousness are drowned. <br>
How distant is that perfumed paradise!<br>
</p>

<p>
But the green paradise of childish love,<br>
Of races, songs, and kisses, and bouquets,<br>
Of fiddles shrilling in the hills above,<br>
And jars of wine, and woods, and dying rays &mdash; <br>
But the green paradise of childish love,<br>
</p>

<p>
Innocent paradise of furtive joys, <br>
Is it far off as India or Hong Kong? <br>
Could it be conjured by a plaintive voice <br>
Or animated by a silver song &mdash; <br>
That far off paradise of furtive joys?<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>


<p>
<b>Moesta Et Errabunda</b>
</p>

<p>
Agatha, tell me, thy heart &mdash; does it sometimes fly away, <br>
Far from the vast dark ocean of the mournful town, <br>
Toward one still vaster, mirroring the blue, blue day, <br>
Mindless and deep: a flood wherein all sorrows drown? <br>
Agatha, tell me, thy heart &mdash; does it sometimes fly away?<br>
</p>

<p>
The sea, the enormous sea has rest for our desires: <br>
By what demoniac irony can that fierce thing, <br>
That raucous howler to the winds' untuneful choirs, <br>
Assuage our deepest woe with its wild clarnouring? <br>
The sea, the enormous sea has rest for our desires.<br>
</p>

<p>
Carry me off, loud trains! Abstract me, silent ships,<br>
Far, far! Here even the earth is miry with our tears!<br>
Is it not true that sometimes Agatha's sweet lips<br>
Murmur: "Far from regrets, from griefs, from cruel fears,<br>
Carry me off, loud trains! Abstract me, silent ships!"<br>
</p>

<p>
How far, how far away, that paradise above,<br>
Wbere all our ills supposedly are put to rest,<br>
Where everything we love is worthy of our love,<br>
And the unburdened heart lies weightless in the breast<br>
How far, how far away, that paradise above!<br>
</p>

<p>
But the green, earthly paradise of childhood, even,<br>
The songs, the furtive kisses, the dances, the bouquets,<br>
The picnics on the hillside &mdash; that unpretentious heaven<br>
Of summer twilights where a distant music plays:<br>
But the green, earthly paradise of childhood, even,<br>
</p>

<p>
Where all our cares are mended in small secret joys &mdash; <br>
Is it already farther than Shanghai or Ceylon? <br>
Or has the heart some kingdom no suffering destroys, <br>
Where those young voices laugh, where those old tunes play on <br>
Where all our cares are mended in small secret joys?<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; George Dillon, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Moesta et Errabunda</b>
</p>

<p>
Oh, Agatha, tell! does thy heart not at times fly away? <br>
Far from the city impure and the lowering sea, <br>
To another ocean that blinds with its dazzling array, <br>
So blue and so clear and profound, like virginity? <br>
Oh, Agatha, tell! does thy heart not at times fly away? <br>
</p>

<p>
The sea, the vast ocean our travail and trouble consoles! <br>
What demon hath gifted the sea with a voice from on high, <br>
To sing us (attuned to an Aeolus-organ that rolls <br>
Forth a grumbling burden) a lenitive lullabye? <br>
The sea, the vast ocean our travail and trouble consoles! <br>
</p>

<p>
Oh, carry me, waggons, oh, sailing-ships, help me depart! <br>
Far, far, here the dust is quite wet with our showering tears, <br>
Oh, say! it is true that Agatha's desolate heart, <br>
Proclaimeth, "Away from remorse, and from crimes, and from cares,"<br>
Oh, carry me, waggons, oh, sailing ships, help me depart! <br>
</p>

<p>
How distant you seem to be, perfumed Elysian fields! <br>
Wherein there is nothing but sunshine and love and glee;<br>
Where all that one loves is so worthy, and lovingly yields, <br>
And our hearts float about in the purest of ecstasy, <br>
How distant you seem to be, perfumed Elysian fields! <br>
</p>

<p>
But the green paradise of those transient infantile loves, <br>
The strolls, and the songs, and the kisses, and bunches of flowers, <br>
The viols vibrating beyond, in the mountainous groves, <br>
With the chalice of wine and the evening, entwined, in the bowers, <br>
But the green paradise of those transient infantile loves. <br>
</p>

<p>
That innocent heaven o'erflowing with furtive delight, <br>
Than China or India, is it still further away? <br>
Or, could one with pityful prayers bring it back to our sight? <br>
Or yet with a silvery voice o'er the ages convey <br>
That innocent heaven o'erflowing with furtive delight! <br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Cyril Scott, <i>Baudelaire: The Flowers of Evil</i> (London: Elkin Mathews, 1909)
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Weeping and Wandering</b>
</p>

<p>
Say, Agatha, if at times your spirit turns<br>
Far from the black sea of the city's mud,<br>
To another ocean, where the splendour burns<br>
All blue, and clear, and deep as maidenhood?<br>
Say, Agatha, if your spirit thither turns?<br>
</p>

<p>
The boundless sea consoles the weary mind!<br>
What demon gave the sea -- that chantress hoarse<br>
To the huge organ of the chiding wind -- <br>
The function grand to rock us like a nurse?<br>
The boundless ocean soothes the jaded mind!<br>
</p>

<p>
O car and frigate, bear me far away,<br>
For here our tears moisten the very clay.<br>
Is't true that Agatha's sad heart at times<br>
Says, Far from sorrows, from remorse, from crimes,<br>
Remove me, car, and, frigate, bear away?<br>
</p>

<p>
O perfumed paradise, how far removed,<br>
Where 'neath a clear sky all is love and joy,<br>
Where all we love is worthy to be loved,<br>
And pleasure drowns the heart, but does not cloy.<br>
O perfumed paradise, so far removed!<br>
</p>

<p>
But the green paradise of childlike loves,<br>
The walks, the songs, the kisses, and the flowers,<br>
The violins dying behind the hills, the hours<br>
Of evening and the wine-flasks in the groves.<br>
But the green paradise of early loves,<br>
</p>

<p>
The innocent paradise, full of stolen joys,<br>
Is't farther off than ev'n the Indian main?<br>
Can we recall it with out plaintive cries,<br>
Or give it life, with silvery voice, again,<br>
The innocent paradise, full of furtive joys?<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Richard Herne Shepherd, <i>Translations from Charles Baudelaire</i> (London: John Camden Hotten, 1869)
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Moesta et errabunda</b>
</p>

<p>
say, Agatha, dost thou in dreams delight<br>
&mdash; far, far from Paris, black and miry sea &mdash;<br>
to rove where other oceans burst in light,<br>
blue, deep, and crystal-clear as chastity?<br>
say, Agatha, dost thou in dreams delight?<br>
</p>

<p>
the vast, vast ocean is our comforter!<br>
what demon gave the hoarse resounding sea<br>
&mdash; and the gruff winds' great organ made for her &mdash;<br>
that siren voice to soothe our misery?<br>
the vast, vast ocean is our comforter!<br>
</p>

<p>
bear me away, swift car and frigate smart!<br>
afar! &mdash; afar! this mire is made of tears!<br>
&mdash; Agatha, truly does thy mournful heart<br>
cry out: afar from sin, remorse and fears,<br>
bear me away, swift car and frigate smart!<br>
</p>

<p>
how far from us that fragrant Eden lies,<br>
where all is azure clear and love and joy,<br>
where all we loved was worthy in love's eyes,<br>
where hearts were drowned in bliss without alloy!<br>
how far from us that fragrant Eden lies!<br>
</p>

<p>
but the green Eden of our earliest loves<br>
&mdash; songs, roses, races, with a kiss to win,<br>
the jugs of wine at dusk in shadowy groves<br>
where died, afar, a quivering violin,<br>
&mdash; but the green Eden of our earliest loves,<br>
</p>

<p>
our Eden of pure tremulous joy and bliss<br>
&mdash; is it now farther than the Asian shore?<br>
can tears or cries recall each magic kiss,<br>
or prayers or silvery words some eve restore<br>
our Eden of pure tremulous joy and bliss?<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Lewis Piaget Shanks, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (New York: Ives Washburn, 1931)<br>
