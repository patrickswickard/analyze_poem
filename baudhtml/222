<b>Les Petites Vieilles</b><br>
</p>

<p>
<i>&Agrave; Victor Hugo</i><br>
</p>

<p>
I
</p>

<p>
Dans les plis sinueux des vieilles capitales,<br>
O&ugrave; tout, m&ecirc;me l'horreur, tourne aux enchantements,<br>
Je guette, ob&eacute;issant &agrave; mes humeurs fatales,<br>
Des &ecirc;tres singuliers, d&eacute;cr&eacute;pits et charmants.<br>
</p>

<p>
Ces monstres disloqu&eacute;s furent jadis des femmes,<br>
Eponine ou La&iuml;s! Monstres bris&eacute;s, bossus<br>
Ou tordus, aimons-les! ce sont encor des &acirc;mes.<br>
Sous des jupons trou&eacute;s et sous de froids tissus<br>
</p>

<p>
Ils rampent, flagell&eacute;s par les bises iniques,<br>
Fr&eacute;missant au fracas roulant des omnibus,<br>
Et serrant sur leur flanc, ainsi que des reliques,<br>
Un petit sac brod&eacute; de fleurs ou de r&eacute;bus;<br>
</p>

<p>
Ils trottent, tout pareils &agrave; des marionnettes;<br>
Se tra&icirc;nent, comme font les animaux bless&eacute;s,<br>
Ou dansent, sans vouloir danser, pauvres sonnettes<br>
O&ugrave; se pend un D&eacute;mon sans piti&eacute;! Tout cass&eacute;s<br>
</p>

<p>
Qu'ils sont, ils ont des yeux per&ccedil;ants comme une vrille,<br>
Luisants comme ces trous o&ugrave; l'eau dort dans la nuit;<br>
Ils ont les yeux divins de la petite fille<br>
Qui s'&eacute;tonne et qui rit &agrave; tout ce qui reluit.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Avez-vous observ&eacute; que maints cercueils de vieilles<br>
Sont presque aussi petits que celui d'un enfant?<br>
La Mort savante met dans ces bi&egrave;res pareilles<br>
Un symbole d'un go&ucirc;t bizarre et captivant,<br>
</p>

<p>
Et lorsque j'entrevois un fant&ocirc;me d&eacute;bile<br>
Traversant de Paris le fourmillant tableau,<br>
Il me semble toujours que cet &ecirc;tre fragile<br>
S'en va tout doucement vers un nouveau berceau;<br>
</p>

<p>
&Agrave; moins que, m&eacute;ditant sur la g&eacute;om&eacute;trie,<br>
Je ne cherche, &agrave; l'aspect de ces membres discords,<br>
Combien de fois il faut que l'ouvrier varie<br>
La forme de la bo&icirc;te o&ugrave; l'on met tous ces corps.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Ces yeux sont des puits faits d'un million de larmes,<br>
Des creusets qu'un m&eacute;tal refroidi pailleta...<br>
Ces yeux myst&eacute;rieux ont d'invincibles charmes<br>
Pour celui que l'aust&egrave;re Infortune allaita!<br>
</p>

<p>
II
</p>

<p>
De Frascati d&eacute;funt Vestale enamour&eacute;e;<br>
Pr&ecirc;tresse de Thalie, h&eacute;las! dont le souffleur<br>
Enterr&eacute; sait le nom; c&eacute;l&egrave;bre &eacute;vapor&eacute;e<br>
Que Tivoli jadis ombragea dans sa fleur,<br>
</p>

<p>
Toutes m'enivrent; mais parmi ces &ecirc;tres fr&ecirc;les<br>
Il en est qui, faisant de la douleur un miel,<br>
Ont dit au D&eacute;vouement qui leur pr&ecirc;tait ses ailes:<br>
Hippogriffe puissant, m&egrave;ne-moi jusqu'au ciel!<br>
</p>

<p>
L'une, par sa patrie au malheur exerc&eacute;e,<br>
L'autre, que son &eacute;poux surchargea de douleurs,<br>
L'autre, par son enfant Madone transperc&eacute;e,<br>
Toutes auraient pu faire un fleuve avec leurs pleurs!<br>
</p>

<p>
III
</p>

<p>
Ah! que j'en ai suivi de ces petites vieilles!<br>
Une, entre autres, &agrave; l'heure o&ugrave; le soleil tombant<br>
Ensanglante le ciel de blessures vermeilles,<br>
Pensive, s'asseyait &agrave; l'&eacute;cart sur un banc,<br>
</p>

<p>
Pour entendre un de ces concerts, riches de cuivre,<br>
Dont les soldats parfois inondent nos jardins,<br>
Et qui, dans ces soirs d'or o&ugrave; l'on se sent revivre,<br>
Versent quelque h&eacute;ro&iuml;sme au coeur des citadins.<br>
</p>

<p>
Celle-l&agrave;, droite encor, fi&egrave;re et sentant la r&egrave;gle,<br>
Humait avidement ce chant vif et guerrier;<br>
Son oeil parfois s'ouvrait comme l'oeil d'un vieil aigle;<br>
Son front de marbre avait l'air fait pour le laurier!<br>
</p>

<p>
IV
</p>

<p>
Telles vous cheminez, sto&iuml;ques et sans plaintes,<br>
&Agrave; travers le chaos des vivantes cit&eacute;s,<br>
M&egrave;res au coeur saignant, courtisanes ou saintes,<br>
Dont autrefois les noms par tous &eacute;taient cit&eacute;s.<br>
</p>

<p>
Vous qui f&ucirc;tes la gr&acirc;ce ou qui f&ucirc;tes la gloires,<br>
Nul ne vous reconna&icirc;t! un ivrogne incivil<br>
Vous insulte en passant d'un amour d&eacute;risoire;<br>
Sur vos talons gambade un enfant l&acirc;che et vil.<br>
</p>

<p>
Honteuses d'exister, ombres ratatin&eacute;es,<br>
Peureuses, le dos bas, vous c&ocirc;toyez les murs;<br>
Et nul ne vous salue, &eacute;tranges destin&eacute;es!<br>
D&eacute;bris d'humanit&eacute; pour l'&eacute;ternit&eacute; m&ucirc;rs!<br>
</p>

<p>
Mais moi, moi qui de loin tendrement vous surveille,<br>
L'oeil inquiet, fix&eacute; sur vos pas incertains,<br>
Tout comme si j'&eacute;tais votre p&egrave;re, &ocirc; merveille!<br>
Je go&ucirc;te &agrave; votre insu des plaisirs clandestins:<br>
</p>

<p>
Je vois s'&eacute;panouir vos passions novices;<br>
Sombres ou lumineux, je vis vos jours perdus;<br>
Mon coeur multipli&eacute; jouit de tous vos vices!<br>
Mon &acirc;me resplendit de toutes vos vertus!<br>
</p>

<p>
Ruines! ma famille! &ocirc; cerveaux cong&eacute;n&egrave;res!<br>
Je vous fais chaque soir un solennel adieu!<br>
O&ugrave; serez-vous demain, Eves octog&eacute;naires,<br>
Sur qui p&egrave;se la griffe effroyable de Dieu? <br>
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>Little Old Women</b><br>
</p>

<p>
To Victor Hugo<br>
</p>

<p>
I<br>
</p>

<p>
In the sinuous folds of the old capitals, <br>
Where all, even horror, becomes pleasant, <br>
I watch, obedient to my fatal whims, <br>
For singular creatures, decrepit and charming.<br>
</p>

<p>
These disjointed monsters were women long ago,<br>
Eponine or Lais! Monsters, hunch-backed, broken<br>
Or distorted, let us love them! they still have souls.<br>
Clothed in tattered petticoats and flimsy dresses<br>
</p>

<p>
They creep, lashed by the iniquitous wind, <br>
Trembling at the clatter of the omnibuses, <br>
Each pressing to her side, as if it were a relic, <br>
A small purse embroidered with rebuses or flowers;<br>
</p>

<p>
They trot exactly like marionettes;<br>
They drag themselves along like wounded animals,<br>
Or dance, against their will, poor little bells<br>
Pulled constantly by a heartless Demon! Broken<br>
</p>

<p>
Though they are, they have eyes as piercing as gimlets, <br>
That shine like those holes in which water sleeps at night; <br>
They have the divine eyes of little girls <br>
Who are amazed and laugh at everything that gleams.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Have you observed how frequently coffins<br>
For old women are almost as small as a child's?<br>
Clever Death brings to these similar biers<br>
A symbol of a strange and captivating taste,<br>
</p>

<p>
And when I catch a glimpse of a feeble specter <br>
Crossing the swarming scene that is Paris, <br>
It always seems to me that that fragile creature <br>
Is going quietly toward a second cradle;<br>
</p>

<p>
Unless, pondering on geometry, <br>
I try, at the sight of those discordant members, <br>
To figure how many times the workman changes <br>
The shape of the boxes where those bodies are laid.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Those eyes are wells filled with a million tears, <br>
Crucibles which a quenched metal spangled...<br>
Those mysterious eyes have invincible charms <br>
For one whom austere Misfortune has suckled!<br>
</p>

<p>
II<br>
</p>

<p>
Vestal in love with the late Frascati;<br>
High priestess of Thalia, whose name is known<br>
To her buried prompter; vanished celebrity<br>
Whom Tivoli sheltered at the peak of her fame,<br>
</p>

<p>
They all enrapture me; among those frail beings <br>
There are some who, making honey out of sorrow, <br>
Have said to Devotion who had lent them his wings: <br>
"Powerful hippogriff, carry me to the sky!"<br>
</p>

<p>
One, inured to misfortune by her fatherland, <br>
Another, overwhelmed with grief by her husband, <br>
Another, a Madonna transfixed by her child, <br>
Each could have made a river with her tears!<br>
</p>

<p>
III<br>
</p>

<p>
Ah! how many of these women I have followed!<br>
One, among others, at the hour when the sunset<br>
Makes the sky bloody with vermilion wounds,<br>
Pensive, used to sit alone on a bench<br>
</p>

<p>
To hear one of those concerts rich in brass, <br>
With which the soldiers sometimes flood our public parks <br>
On those golden evenings when one feels new life within <br>
And which inspire heroism in the townsman's heart.<br>
</p>

<p>
Proud, still erect, feeling she must sit thus,<br>
She thirstily drank in that stirring, martial song;<br>
Her eyes opened at times like the eyes of an old eagle;<br>
Her marble brow seemed to be made for the laurel!<br>
</p>

<p>
IV<br>
</p>

<p>
Thus you trudge along, stoical, uncomplaining, <br>
Amid the confusion of cities full of life, <br>
Mothers with bleeding hearts, courtesans, saints, <br>
Whose names in years gone by were on everyone's lips.<br>
</p>

<p>
O you who were charming or who were glorious, <br>
None recognizes you! A drunken ruffian <br>
Passing by insults you with an obscene remark; <br>
A dirty, nasty child frisks about at your heels.<br>
</p>

<p>
Wizened shadows, ashamed of existing, <br>
With bent backs, you timidly keep close to the walls <br>
And no person greets you, strange destinies! <br>
Human wreckage, ripe for eternity!<br>
</p>

<p>
But I, I watch you tenderly from a distance; <br>
My anxious eyes are fixed on your uncertain steps, <br>
As if I were your own father; how wonderful!<br>
I taste unknown to you clandestine pleasures:<br>
</p>

<p>
I see your untried passions come into full bloom;<br>
I live your vanished days, gloomy or filled with light;<br>
My heart multiplied enjoys all of your vices!<br>
My soul is resplendent with all of your virtues!<br>
</p>

<p>
Ruins! my family! O kindred minds! <br>
I bid you each evening a solemn farewell! <br>
Octogenarian Eves, upon whom rests <br>
God's terrible claw, where will you be tomorrow?<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Little Old Women</b>
</p>

<p>
To Victor Hugo<br>
</p>

<p>
I<br>
</p>

<p>
in sinuous folds of cities old and grim, <br>
Where all things, even horror, turn to grace, <br>
I follow, in obedience to my whim, <br>
Strange, feeble, charming creatures round the place.<br>
</p>

<p>
These crooked freaks were women in their pride,<br>
Fair Eponine or Lais! Humped and bent,<br>
Love them! Because they still have souls inside.<br>
Under their draughty skirts in tatters rent,<br>
</p>

<p>
They crawl: a vicious wind their carrion rides; <br>
From the deep roar of traffic see them cower, <br>
Pressing like precious relies to their sides <br>
Some satchel stitched with mottoes or a flower.<br>
</p>

<p>
They trot like marionettes along the level, <br>
Or drag themselves like wounded deer, poor crones! <br>
Or dance, against their will, as if the devil <br>
Were swinging in the belfry of their bones.<br>
</p>

<p>
Cracked though they are, their eyes are sharp as drills <br>
And shine, like pools of water in the night, &mdash; <br>
The eyes of little girls whom wonder thrills <br>
To laugh at all that sparkles and is bright.<br>
</p>

<p>
The coffins of old women very often <br>
Are near as small as those of children are. <br>
Wise Death, who makes a symbol of a coffin <br>
Displays a taste both charming and bizarre.<br>
</p>

<p>
And when I track some feeble phantom fleeing <br>
Through Paris's immense ant-swarming Babel, <br>
I always think that such a fragile being <br>
Is moving softly to another cradle.<br>
</p>

<p>
Unless, sometimes, in geometric mood, <br>
To see the strange deformities they offer, <br>
I muse how often he who saws the wood <br>
Must change the shape and outline of the coffer.<br>
</p>

<p>
Those eyes are wells a million teardrops feed, <br>
Crucibles spangled by a cooling ore, <br>
Invincible in charm to all that breed <br>
Austere Misfortune suckled with her lore.<br>
</p>

<p>
II<br>
</p>

<p>
Vestal whom old Frascati could enamour:<br>
Thalia's nun, whose name was only known<br>
To her dead prompter: madcap full of glamour<br>
Whom Tivoli once sheltered as its own &mdash; <br>
</p>

<p>
They all elate me. But of these a few, <br>
Of sorrow having made a honeyed leaven, <br>
Say to Devotion, "Lend me wings anew, <br>
O powerful Hippogriff, and fly to heaven."<br>
</p>

<p>
One for her fatherland a martyr: one <br>
By her own husband wronged beyond belief: <br>
And one a pierced Madonna through her son &mdash; <br>
They all could make a river with their grief.<br>
</p>

<p>
III<br>
</p>

<p>
Yes, I have followed them, time and again!<br>
One, I recall, when sunset, like a heart,<br>
Bled through the sky from wounds of ruddy stain,<br>
Pensively sat upon a seat apart,<br>
</p>

<p>
To listen to the music, rich in metal <br>
That's played by bands of soldiers in the parks <br>
On golden, soul-reviving eves, to fettle, <br>
From meek civilian hearts, heroic sparks.<br>
</p>

<p>
This one was straight and stiff, in carriage regal, <br>
She breathed the warrior-music through her teeth, <br>
Opened her eye like that of an old eagle, <br>
And bared a forehead moulded for a wreath.<br>
</p>

<p>
IV<br>
</p>

<p>
Thus, then, you journey, uncomplaining, stoic<br>
Across the strife of modern cities flung,<br>
Sad mothers, courtesans, or saints heroic,<br>
Whose names of old were heard on every tongue,<br>
</p>

<p>
You once were grace, and you were glory once. <br>
None know you now. Derisory advances <br>
Some drunkard makes you, mixed with worse affronts. <br>
And on your heels a child-tormentor prances.<br>
</p>

<p>
But I who watch you tenderly: and measure <br>
With anxious eye, your weak unsteady gait <br>
As would a father &mdash; get a secret pleasure <br>
On your account, as on your steps I wait.<br>
</p>

<p>
I see your passionate and virgin crazes; <br>
Sombre or bright, I see your vanished prime; <br>
My soul, resplendent with your virtue, blazes, <br>
And revels in your vices and your crimes.<br>
</p>

<p>
Poor wrecks! My family! Kindred in mind, you <br>
Receive from me each day my last addresses. <br>
Eighty-year Eves, will yet tomorrow find you <br>
On whom the claw of God so fiercely presses?<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>The Little Old Women</b>
</p>

<p>
I<br>
</p>

<p>
Deep in the tortuous folds of ancient towns,<br>
Where all, even horror, to enchantment turns,<br>
I watch, obedient to my fatal mood,<br>
For the decrepit, strange and charming beings,<br>
The dislocated monsters that of old<br>
Were lovely women &mdash; Lais or Eponine!<br>
Hunchbacked and broken, crooked though they be,<br>
Let us still love them, for they still have souls.<br>
They creep along wrapped in their chilly rags,<br>
Beneath the whipping of the wicked wind,<br>
They tremble when an omnibus rolls by,<br>
And at their sides, a relic of the past,<br>
A little flower-embroidered satchel hangs.<br>
They trot about, most like to marionettes;<br>
They drag themselves, as does a wounded beast;<br>
Or dance unwillingly as a clapping bell<br>
Where hangs and swings a demon without pity.<br>
Though they be broken they have piercing eyes,<br>
That shine like pools where water sleeps at night;<br>
The astonished and divine eyes of a child<br>
who laughs at all that glitters in the world.<br>
Have you not seen that most old women's shrouds<br>
Are little like the shroud of a dead child?<br>
Wise Death, in token of his happy whim,<br>
Wraps old and young in one enfolding sheet.<br>
And when I see a phantom, frail and wan,<br>
Traverse the swarming picture that is Paris,<br>
It ever seems as though the delicate thing<br>
Trod with soft steps towards a cradle new.<br>
And then I wonder, seeing the twisted form,<br>
How many times must workmen change the shape<br>
Of boxes where at length such limbs are laid?<br>
These eyes are wells brimmed with a million tears;<br>
Crucibles where the cooling metal pales &mdash; <br>
Mysterious eyes that are strong charms to him<br>
Whose life-long nurse has been austere Disaster.<br>
</p>

<p>
II<br>
</p>

<p>
The love-sick vestal of the old "Frasciti";<br>
Priestess of Thalia, alas! whose name<br>
Only the prompter knows and he is dead;<br>
Bygone celebrities that in bygone days<br>
The Tivoli o'ershadowed in their bloom;<br>
All charm me; yet among these beings frail<br>
Three, turning pain to honey-sweetness, said<br>
To the Devotion that had lent them wings:<br>
"Lift me, O powerful Hippogriffe, to the skies" &mdash; <br>
One by her country to despair was driven;<br>
One by her husband overwhelmed with grief;<br>
One wounded by her child, Madonna-like;<br>
Each could have made a river with her tears.<br>
</p>

<p>
III<br>
</p>

<p>
Oft have I followed one of these old women,<br>
One among others, when the falling sun<br>
Reddened the heavens with a crimson wound &mdash; <br>
Pensive, apart, she rested on a bench<br>
To hear the brazen music of the band,<br>
Played by the soldiers in the public park<br>
To pour some courage into citizens' hearts,<br>
On golden eves when all the world revives.<br>
Proud and erect she drank the music in,<br>
The lively and the warlike call to arms;<br>
Her eyes blinked like an ancient eagle's eyes;<br>
Her forehead seemed to await the laurel crown!<br>
</p>

<p>
IV<br>
</p>

<p>
Thus you do wander, uncomplaining Stoics,<br>
Through all the chaos of the living town:<br>
Mothers with bleeding hearts, saints, courtesans,<br>
Whose names of yore were on the lips of all;<br>
Who were all glory and all grace, and now<br>
None know you; and the brutish drunkard stops,<br>
Insulting you with his derisive love;<br>
And cowardly urchins call behind your back.<br>
Ashamed of living, withered shadows all,<br>
With fear-bowed backs you creep beside the walls,<br>
And none salute you, destined to loneliness!<br>
Refuse of Time ripe for Eternity!<br>
But I, who watch you tenderly afar,<br>
With unquiet eyes on your uncertain steps,<br>
As though I were your father, I &mdash; O wonder! &mdash; <br>
Unknown to you taste secret, hidden joy.<br>
I see your maiden passions bud and bloom,<br>
Sombre or luminous, and your lost days<br>
Unroll before me while my heart enjoys<br>
All your old vices, and my soul expands<br>
To all the virtues that have once been yours.<br>
Ruined! and my sisters! O congenerate hearts,<br>
Octogenarian Eves o'er whom is stretched<br>
God's awful claw, where will you be to-morrow?<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; F.P. Sturm, from <i>Baudelaire: His Prose and Poetry</i>, edited by Thomas Robert Smith (New York: Boni and Liveright, 1919)
