<b>Les Bijoux</b><br>
</p>

<p>
La tr&egrave;s ch&egrave;re &eacute;tait nue, et, connaissant mon coeur, <br>
Elle n'avait gard&eacute; que ses bijoux sonores, <br>
Dont le riche attirail lui donnait l'air vainqueur <br>
Qu'ont dans leurs jours heureux les esclaves des Mores.<br>
</p>

<p>
Quand il jette en dansant son bruit vif et moqueur, <br>
Ce monde rayonnant de m&eacute;tal et de pierre <br>
Me ravit en extase, et j'aime &agrave; la fureur <br>
Les choses o&ugrave; le son se m&ecirc;le &agrave; la lumi&egrave;re.<br>
</p>

<p>
Elle &eacute;tait donc couch&eacute;e et se laissait aimer, <br>
Et du haut du divan elle souriait d'aise <br>
&Agrave; mon amour profond et doux comme la mer, <br>
Qui vers elle montait comme vers sa falaise.<br>
</p>

<p>
Les yeux fix&eacute;s sur moi, comme un tigre dompt&eacute;, <br>
D'un air vague et r&ecirc;veur elle essayait des poses, <br>
Et la candeur unie &agrave; la lubricit&eacute; <br>
Donnait un charme neuf &agrave; ses m&eacute;tamorphoses;<br>
</p>

<p>
Et son bras et sa jambe, et sa cuisse et ses reins, <br>
Polis comme de l'huile, onduleux comme un cygne, <br>
Passaient devant mes yeux clairvoyants et sereins; <br>
Et son ventre et ses seins, ces grappes de ma vigne,<br>
</p>

<p>
S'avan&ccedil;aient, plus c&acirc;lins que les Anges du mal, <br>
Pour troubler le repos o&ugrave; mon &acirc;me &eacute;tait mise, <br>
Et pour la d&eacute;ranger du rocher de cristal <br>
O&ugrave;, calme et solitaire, elle s'&eacute;tait assise.<br>
</p>

<p>
Je croyais voir unis par un nouveau dessin <br>
Les hanches de l'Antiope au buste d'un imberbe, <br>
Tant sa taille faisait ressortir son bassin. <br>
Sur ce teint fauve et brun, le fard &eacute;tait superbe!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Et la lampe s'&eacute;tant r&eacute;sign&eacute;e &agrave; mourir, <br>
Comme le foyer seul illuminait la chambre <br>
Chaque fois qu'il poussait un flamboyant soupir, <br>
Il inondait de sang cette peau couleur d'ambre!
</p>
<p>&mdash; <i>Charles Baudelaire</i></p><br /><p>
<b>The Jewels</b><br>
</p>

<p>
My darling was naked, and knowing my heart well, <br>
She was wearing only her sonorous jewels, <br>
Whose opulent display made her look triumphant <br>
Like Moorish concubines on their fortunate days.<br>
</p>

<p>
When it dances and flings its lively, mocking sound, <br>
This radiant world of metal and of gems <br>
Transports me with delight; I passionately love <br>
All things in which sound is mingled with light.<br>
</p>

<p>
She had lain down; and let herself be loved <br>
From the top of the couch she smiled contentedly <br>
Upon my love, deep and gentle as the sea, <br>
Which rose toward her as toward a cliff.<br>
</p>

<p>
Her eyes fixed upon me, like a tamed tigress, <br>
With a vague, dreamy air she was trying poses, <br>
And by blending candor with lechery, <br>
Her metamorphoses took on a novel charm;<br>
</p>

<p>
And her arm and her leg, and her thigh and her loins,<br>
Shiny as oil, sinuous as a swan,<br>
Passed in front of my eyes, clear-sighted and serene;<br>
And her belly, her breasts, grapes of my vine,<br>
</p>

<p>
Advanced, more cajoling than angels of evil, <br>
To trouble the quiet that had possessed my soul, <br>
To dislodge her from the crag of crystal, <br>
Where calm and alone she had taken her seat.<br>
</p>

<p>
I thought I saw blended in a novel design<br>
Antiope's haunches and the breast of a boy,<br>
Her waist set off so well the fullness of her hips.<br>
On that tawny brown skin the rouge stood out superb!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; And when at last the lamp allowed itself to die,<br>
Since the fire alone lighted the room,<br>
Each time that it uttered a flaming sigh,<br>
It drenched with blood that amber colored skin!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; William Aggeler, <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)<br>

<p>
<b>The Jewels</b>
</p>

<p>
My well-beloved was stripped. Knowing my whim, <br>
She wore her tinkling gems, but naught besides: <br>
And showed such pride as, while her luck betides, <br>
A sultan's favoured slave may show to him.<br>
</p>

<p>
When it lets off its lively, crackling sound, <br>
This blazing blend of metal crossed with stone, <br>
Gives me an ecstasy I've only known <br>
Where league of sound and lustre can be found.<br>
</p>

<p>
She let herself be loved: then, drowsy-eyed, <br>
Smiled down from her high couch in languid ease. <br>
My love was deep and gentle as the seas <br>
And rose to her as to a cliff the tide.<br>
</p>

<p>
My own approval of each dreamy pose,<br>
Like a tarned tiger, cunningly she sighted:<br>
And candour, with lubricity united,<br>
Gave piquancy to every one she chose,<br>
</p>

<p>
Her limbs and hips, burnished with changing lustres,<br>
Before my eyes clairvoyant and serene,<br>
Swarmed themselves, undulating in their sheen;<br>
Her breasts and belly, of my vine the clusters,<br>
</p>

<p>
Like evil angels rose, my fancy twitting, <br>
To kill the peace which over me she'd thrown, <br>
And to disturb her from the crystal throne <br>
Where, calm and solitary, she was sitting.<br>
</p>

<p>
So swerved her pelvis that, in one design, <br>
Antiope's white rump it seemed to graft <br>
To a boy's torso, merging fore and aft. <br>
The talc on her brown tan seemed half-divine.<br>
</p>

<p>
The lamp resigned its dying flame. Within, <br>
The hearth alone lit up the darkened air, <br>
And every time it sighed a crimson flare <br>
It drowned in blood that amber-coloured skin.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br>

<p>
<b>The Jewels</b><br>
</p>

<p>
The lovely one was naked and, knowing well my prayer, <br>
She wore her loud bright armory of jewels. They <br>
Evoked in her the savage and victorious air <br>
Of Moorish concubines upon a holiday.<br>
</p>

<p>
When it gives forth, being shaken, its gay mocking noise, <br>
This world of metal and of stone, aflare in the night, <br>
Excites me monstrously, for chiefest of my joys <br>
Is the luxurious commingling of sound and light.<br>
</p>

<p>
Relaxed among the pillows, she looked down at me <br>
And let herself be gazed upon at leisure &mdash; as if <br>
Lulled by my wordless adoration, like the sea <br>
Washing perpetually about the foot of a cliff.<br>
</p>

<p>
Slowly, regarding me like a trained leopardess, <br>
She slouched into successive poses. A certain ease, <br>
A certain candor coupled with lasciviousness, <br>
Lent a new charm to the old metamorphoses.<br>
</p>

<p>
The whole lithe harmony of loins, hips, buttocks, thighs,<br>
Tawny and sleek, and undulant as the neck of a swan,<br>
Began to move hypnotically before my eyes:<br>
And her large breasts, those fruits I have grown lean upon,<br>
</p>

<p>
I saw float toward me, tempting as the angels of hell, <br>
To win my soul in thralldom to their dark caprice <br>
Once more, and lure it down from the high citadel <br>
Where, calm and solitary, it thought to have found peace.<br>
</p>

<p>
She stretched and reared, and made herself all belly. In truth,<br>
It was as if some playful artist had joined the stout<br>
Hips of Antiope to the torso of a youth!...<br>
The room grew dark, the lamp having flickered and gone out,<br>
</p>

<p>
And now the whispering fire that had begun to die, <br>
Falling in lucent embers, was all the light therein &mdash; <br>
And when it heaved at moments a flamboyant sigh <br>
It inundated as with blood her amber skin.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; George Dillon, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br>

<p>
<b>The Jewels</b><br>
</p>

<p>
Naked was my dark love, and, knowing my heart, <br>
Adorned in but her most sonorous gems, <br>
Their high pomp decked her with the conquering art <br>
Of Moorish slave girls crowned with diadems.<br>
</p>

<p>
Dancing for me with lively, mocking sound, <br>
This world of stone and metal, brittle and bright, <br>
Fills me with rapture who have always found <br>
Excess of joy where hue and tone unite.<br>
</p>

<p>
Naked she lay, suffered love pleasurably <br>
To mould her, smiled on my desire as if, <br>
Profound and gentle as the rising sea, <br>
It rode the tide toward its appointed cliff.<br>
</p>

<p>
A tiger, tamed, her eyes on mine, intent <br>
On lust, she sought all strange ways to please: <br>
Her air, half-candid, half-lascivious, lent <br>
A new charm to her metamorphoses.<br>
</p>

<p>
In turn, her arms and limbs, her veins, her thighs,<br>
Polished as nard, undulant as a swan,<br>
Passed under my serene clairvoyant eyes<br>
As belly and breasts, grapes of my vine, moved on.<br>
</p>

<p>
Skilled in more spells than evil angels muster<br>
To break the solace which possessed my heart,<br>
Smashing the crystal rock upon whose luster<br>
My quietude sat on its own, apart,<br>
</p>

<p>
Her waist, awrithe, her belly enormously <br>
Out-thrust, formed strange designs unknown to us,<br>
As if the haunches of Antiope <br>
Flowed from a body not yet Ephebus.<br>
</p>

<p>
Slowly the lamplight sank, resigned to die.<br>
Firelight pierced darkness, stud on glowing stud, <br>
Each time it heaved a sharply flaming sigh <br>
It steeped her amber flesh in pools of blood.<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; Jacques LeClercq, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (Mt Vernon, NY: Peter Pauper Press, 1958)<br>

<b>Jewels</b>

<p>
The darling one was naked and, knowing my wish,<br>
Had kept only the regalia of her jewelry<br>
Whose resonant charms can lure and vanquish<br>
Like a Moorish, slave-girl's in her moment of glory.<br>
</p>

<p>
A world of dazzling stones and of precious metals<br>
Flinging, in its quick rhythm, glints of mockery<br>
Ravishes me into ecstasy, I love to madness<br>
The mingling of sounds and lights in one intricacy.<br>
</p>

<p>
Naked, then, she was to all of my worship,<br>
Smiling in triumph from the heights of her couch<br>
At my desire advancing, as gentle and deep<br>
As the sea sending its waves to the warm beach.<br>
</p>

<p>
Her eyes fixed as a tiger's in the tamer's trance,<br>
Absent, unthinking, she varied her poses<br>
With an audacity and wild innocence<br>
That gave a strange pang to each metamorphosis.<br>
</p>

<p>
Her long legs, her hips, shining smooth as oil,<br>
Her arms and her thighs, undulant as a swan,<br>
Lured my serene, clairvoyant gaze to travel<br>
To her belly and breasts, the grapes of my vine.<br>
</p>

<p>
With a charm as powerful as an evil angel<br>
To trouble the calm where my soul had retreated,<br>
They advanced slowly to dislodge it from its crystal<br>
Rock, where its loneliness meditated.<br>
</p>

<p>
With the hips of Antiope, the torso of a boy,<br>
So deeply was the one form sprung into the other<br>
It seemed as if desire had fashioned a new toy.<br>
Her farded, fawn-brown skin was perfection to either!<br>
</p>

<p>
&mdash; And the lamp having at last resigned itself to death,<br>
There was nothing now but firelight in the room,<br>
And every time a flame uttered a gasp for breath<br>
It flushed her amber skin with the blood of its bloom.<br>
</p>
