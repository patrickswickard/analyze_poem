The Alchemy of Grief

One, Nature! burns and makes thee bright, 
One gives thee weeds to mourn withal; 
And what to one is burial 
Is to the other life and light. 

The unknown Hermes who assists 
And always fills my heart with fear, 
Makes the mighty Midas' peer 
The saddest of the alchemists. 

Through him I make gold changeable 
To dross, and paradise to hell; 
Clouds for its corpse-cloths I descry. 

A stark dead body I love well, 
And in the gleaming fields on high 
I build immense sarcophagi.
