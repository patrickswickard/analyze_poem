The Wine of Lovers

Today space is magnificent! 
Without bridle or bit or spurs 
Let us ride away on wine 
To a divine, fairy-like heaven!

Like two angels who are tortured 
By a relentless delirium, 
Let us follow the far mirage 
Through the crystal blue of the morning!

Gently balanced upon the wings
Of the intelligent whirlwind,
In a similar ecstasy,

My sister, floating side by side, 
We'll flee without ever stopping 
To the paradise of my dreams!
