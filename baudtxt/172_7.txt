The Joyous Defunct

Where snails abound -- in a juicy soil, 
I will dig for myself a fathomless grave, 
Where at leisure mine ancient bones I can coil, 
And sleep -- quite forgotten -- like a shark 'neath the wave. 

I hate every tomb -- I abominate wills, 
And rather than tears from the world to implore, 
I would ask of the crows with their vampire bills 
To devour every bit of my carcass impure. 

Oh worms, without eyes, without ears, black friends! 
To you a defunct-one, rejoicing, descends, 
Enlivened Philosophers -- offspring of Dung! 

Without any qualms, o'er my wreckage spread, 
And tell if some torment there still can be wrung 
For this soul-less old frame that is dead 'midst the dead!
