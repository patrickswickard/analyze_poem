The Wine of the Solitary Man

The love-glance of a courtesan that swims 
With undulating ray like that the moon 
Sends to the waiting, tremulous lagoon 
Where she's about to lave her languid limbs:

The last few florins in a gambler's fingers: 
The lustful kiss of slender Adeline: 
A haunting tune that wheedles and malingers, 
Wherein all human anguish seems to pine:

All these aren't worth, O bottle kind and deep, 
The penetrating balms that swell your paunch 
The pious poet's wounded heart to staunch.

You pour him hope, youth, life, and healing sleep &mdash; 
And pride, all Beggary's diadem and treasure, 
By which our triumphs with the Gods' we measure.
