The Cat

Come, my fine cat, against my loving heart; 
Sheathe your sharp claws, and settle. 
And let my eyes into your pupils dart 
Where agate sparks with metal.

Now while my fingertips caress at leisure
Your head and wiry curves,
And that my hand's elated with the pleasure
Of your electric nerves,

I think about my woman &mdash; how her glances 
Like yours, dear beast, deep-down 
And cold, can cut and wound one as with lances;

Then, too, she has that vagrant 
And subtle air of danger that makes fragrant 
Her body, lithe and brown.
