The Balcony

Mother of memories, queen of paramours, 
Yourself are all my pleasure, all my duty; 
You will recall caresses that were yours 
And fireside evenings in their warmth and beauty. 
Mother of memories, queen of paramours.

On eves illumined by the light of coal, 
The balcony beneath a rose-veiled sky, 
Your breast how soft! Your heart how good and whole! 
We spoke eternal things that cannot die &mdash; 
On eves illumined by the light of coal!

How splendid sets the sun of a warm evening! 
How deep is space! the heart how full of power! 
When, queen of the adored, towards you leaning, 
I breathed the perfume of your blood in flower. 
How splendid sets the sun of a warm evening!

The evening like an alcove seemed to thicken, 
And as my eyes astrologised your own, 
Drinking your breath, I felt sweet poisons quicken, 
And in my hands your feet slept still as stone. 
The evening like an alcove seemed to thicken.

I know how to resuscitate dead minutes. 
I see my past, its face hid in your knees. 
How can I seek your languorous charm save in its 
Own source, your heart and body formed to please. 
I know how to resuscitate dead minutes.

These vows, these perfumes, and these countless kisses, 
Reborn from gulfs that we could never sound, 
Will they, like suns, once bathed in those abysses, 
Rejuvenated from the deep, rebound &mdash; 
These vows, these perfumes, and these countless kisses?
