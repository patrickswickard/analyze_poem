The Death of the Poor

It's Death that comforts us, alas! and makes us live; 
It is the goal of life; it is the only hope 
Which, like an elixir, makes us inebriate 
And gives us the courage to march until evening;

Through the storm and the snow and the hoar-frost 
It is the vibrant light on our black horizon; 
It is the famous inn inscribed upon the book, 
Where one can eat, and sleep, and take his rest;

It's an Angel who holds in his magnetic hands 
Sleep and the gift of ecstatic dreams 
And who makes the beds for the poor, naked people;

It's the glory of the gods, the mystic granary, 
It is the poor man's purse, his ancient fatherland, 
It is the portal opening on unknown Skies!
