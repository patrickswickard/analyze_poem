Landscape

I would, to compose my eclogues chastely, 
Lie down close to the sky like an astrologer, 
And, near the church towers, listen while I dream 
To their solemn anthems borne to me by the wind. 
My chin cupped in both hands, high up in my garret 
I shall see the workshops where they chatter and sing, 
The chimneys, the belfries, those masts of the city, 
And the skies that make one dream of eternity.

It is sweet, through the mist, to see the stars
Appear in the heavens, the lamps in the windows,
The streams of smoke rise in the firmament
And the moon spread out her pale enchantment.
I shall see the springtimes, the summers, the autumns;
And when winter comes with its monotonous snow,
I shall close all the shutters and draw all the drapes
So I can build at night my fairy palaces.
Then I shall dream of pale blue horizons, gardens,
Fountains weeping into alabaster basins,
Of kisses, of birds singing morning and evening,
And of all that is most childlike in the Idyl.
Riot, storming vainly at my window,
Will not make me raise my head from my desk, 
For I shall be plunged in the voluptuousness 
Of evoking the Springtime with my will alone, 
Of drawing forth a sun from my heart, and making 
Of my burning thoughts a warm atmosphere.
