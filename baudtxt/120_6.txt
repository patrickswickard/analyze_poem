Exotic Perfume

When, with closed eyes, on a hot afternoon, 
The scent of thine ardent breast I inhale, 
Celestial vistas my spirit assail;
Caressed by the flames of an endless sun. 

A langorous island, where Nature abounds 
With exotic trees and luscious fruit; 
And with men whose bodies are slim and astute, 
And with women whose frankness delights and astounds. 

By thy perfume enticed to this region remote, 
A port I see, laden with mast and with boat, 
Still wearied and torn by the distant brine;

While the tamarisk-odours that dreamily throng 
The air, round my slumberous senses intwine, 
And mix, in my soul, with the mariners' song.
