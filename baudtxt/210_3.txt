Song of Afternoon

Though your eyebrows' wicked slant
Give you an intriguing air
Which the angels do not share
Sorceress, whose eyes enchant -- 

My passion, terrible yet gay, 
With all my heart I bow before you, 
With that devotion to adore you 
That priests to sacred idols pay.

Deserts and woods embalmed your hair, 
Its movements give your head the stigma 
Of sphinx-like secret and enigma, 
Both in its attitude and air.

As round a censer vapours form,
About your flesh the perfumes wander.
The selfsame charms you seem to squander
As does an evening, dark yet warm,

The strongest philtres cannot craze 
As does your indolent address 
And you have mastered a caress 
Dead corpses from their tombs to raise.

Your hips are amorous of your breast 
And of your back: your languorous pose 
Enchants the cushions where you doze 
When in their depths you make your nest.

Sometimes in order to appease
Mysterious rages in your soul,
You bite and kiss without control.
Then with a mocking laugh you tease

My heart, brown beauty, tearing it: 
Then over it the light is strewn 
Of your eye, softer than the moon, 
Till with its glance my soul is lit.

Underneath your satin shoes, 
And underneath your silken feet, 
My joy, my fate, my genius meet 
To strew the pathway of my muse.

My soul is healed, restored and made complete 
By you, all colour, warmth, and light, 
In my Siberia a bright 
Explosion as of tropic heat.
