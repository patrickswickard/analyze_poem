Evening Harmony

Now is the time when trembling on its stem
Each flower fades away like incense;
Sounds and scents turn in the evening air;
A melancholy waltz, a soft and giddy dizziness!

Each flower fades away like incense; 
The violin thrills like a tortured heart; 
A melancholy waltz, a soft and giddy dizziness! 
The sky is sad and beautiful like some great resting-place.

The violin thrills like a tortured heart, 
A tender heart, hating the wide black void. 
The sky is sad and beautiful like some great resting-place; 
The sun drowns itself in its own clotting blood.

A tender heart, boring the wide black void,
Gathers all trace from the pellucid past.
The sun drowns itself in clotting blood.
Like the Host shines O your memory in me!
