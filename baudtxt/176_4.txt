The Pipe

An author's favourite pipe am I, 
My Kaffir woman's countenance 
Tells the beholder at a glance 
My master smokes incessantly. 

If he is mournful or in pain 
I smoke as does the ploughman's cot 
When the good wife prepares the pot 
Before her spouse comes home again. 

I bind his soul and rock her well 
In the blue twisting skein which slips 
And rises from my fiery lips, 

And weave a very potent spell 
Which soothes his heart in its distress 
And heals his spirit's weariness.
