Man and the Sea

Free man, you'll always love the sea &mdash; for this, 
That it's a mirror, where you see your soul 
In its eternal waves that chafe and roll; 
Nor is your soul less bitter an abyss.

in your reflected image there to merge, 
You love to dive, its eyes and limbs to match. 
Sometimes your heart forgets its own, to catch 
The rhythm of that wild and tameless dirge.

The two of you are shadowy, deep, and wide. 
Man! None has ever plummeted your floor &mdash; 
Sea! None has ever known what wealth you store &mdash; 
Both are so jealous of the things you hide!

Yet age on age is ended, or begins,
While you without remorse or pity fight.
So much in death and carnage you delight,
Eternal wrestlers! Unrelenting twins!
