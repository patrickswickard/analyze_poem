Parisian Dream

I

That marvelous landscape of my dream &mdash; 
Which no eye knows, nor ever will &mdash;  
At moments, wide awake, I seem 
To grasp, and it excites me still.

Sleep, how miraculous you are &mdash; 
A strange caprice had urged my hand 
To banish, as irregular, 
All vegetation from that land;

And, proud of what my art had done, 
I viewed my painting, knew the great 
Intoxicating monotone 
Of marble, water, steel and slate.

Staircases and arcades there were 
In a long labyrinth, which led 
To a vast palace; fountains there 
Were gushing gold, and gushing lead.

And many a heavy cataract 
Hung like a curtain, &mdash; did not fall, 
As water does, but hung, compact, 
Crystal, on many a metal wall.

Tall nymphs with Titan breasts and knees 
Gazed at their images unblurred, 
Where groves of colonnades, not trees, 
Fringed a deep pool where nothing stirred.

Blue sheets of water, left and right, 
Spread between quays of rose and green, 
To the world's end and out of sight, 
And still expanded, though unseen.

Enchanted rivers, those &mdash; with jade 
And jasper were their banks bedecked; 
Enormous mirrors, dazzled, made 
Dizzy by all they did reflect.

And many a Ganges, taciturn 
And heedless, in the vaulted air, 
Poured out the treasure of its urn 
Into a gulf of diamond there.

As architect, it tempted me 
To tame the ocean at its source; 
And this I did, &mdash; I made the sea 
Under a jeweled culvert course.

And every color, even black, 
Became prismatic, polished, bright; 
The liquid gave its glory back 
Mounted in iridescent light.

There was no moon, there was no sun, &mdash; 
For why should sun and moon conspire
To light such prodigies? &mdash; each one
Blazed with its own essential fire!

A silence like eternity 
Prevailed, there was no sound to hear; 
These marvels all were for the eye, 
And there was nothing for the ear.

II

I woke; my mind was bright with flame; 
I saw the cheap and sordid hole 
I live in, and my cares all came 
Burrowing back into my soul.

Brutally the twelve strokes of noon 
Against my naked ear were hurled; 
And a gray sky was drizzling down 
Upon this sad, lethargic world.
