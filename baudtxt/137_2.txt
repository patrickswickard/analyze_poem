The Living Torch

They walk in front of me, those eyes aglow with light 
Which a learned Angel has rendered magnetic; 
They walk, divine brothers who are my brothers too, 
Casting into my eyes diamond scintillations.

They save me from all snares and from all grievous sin; 
They guide my steps along the pathway of Beauty; 
They are my servitors, I am their humble slave; 
My whole being obeys this living torch.

Bewitching eyes, you shine like mystical candles 
That burn in broad daylight; the sun 
Reddens, but does not quench their eerie flame;

While they celebrate Death, you sing the Awakening; 
You walk, singing the awakening of my soul, 
Bright stars whose flame no sun can pale!
