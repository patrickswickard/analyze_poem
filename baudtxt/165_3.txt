The Gamblers

In faded armchairs, harlots of past years 
Pale, with false eyebrows, wheedling, fatal eyes, 
And weird, affected airs, clink from thin ears 
A feeble sound, where tin with crystal vies.

Round the green tables, faces without lips,
Lips without colour, jaws their teeth surviving,
And fingers which a hellish fever grips
Convulsively in breasts and pockets diving

Under the dirty ceiling, lustres flame 
And chandeliers, that blaze without remittance 
On shady brows of poets dear to fame, 
Who come to waste their sorely-sweated pittance.

Such was the picture, in nocturnal dreaming, 
I saw unfurled to my clairvoyant eye. 
In that grim vault, one form on elbows leaning,
Unspeaking, cold, and envious &mdash; was I! &mdash; 

Yes! envying, for their all-tenacious passion, 
These raddled tarts in their funereal glee, 
Who trafficked there, in such a merry fashion, 
Dead virtue and lost beauty on the spree.

My heart was chilled with fear at envying
Wretches who, headlong, rush to be destroyed,
And, drunk with their own blood, seek anything &mdash; 
Hell, death, or torture &mdash; rather than the Void!
