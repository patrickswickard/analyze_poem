Echoes

In Nature's temple, living columns rise, 
Which oftentimes give tongue to words subdued, 
And Man traverses this symbolic wood, 
Which looks at him with half familiar eyes,

Like lingering echoes, which afar confound 
Themselves in deep and sombre unity, 
As vast as Night, and like transplendency, 
The scents and colours to each other respond. 

And scents there are, like infant's flesh as chaste, 
As sweet as oboes, and as meadows fair, 
And others, proud, corrupted, rich and vast, 

Which have the expansion of infinity, 
Like amber, musk and frankincense and myrrh, 
That sing the soul's and senses' ecstasy.
