Spleen

I have more memories than had I seen 
Ten centuries. A huge chest that has been 
Stuffed full of writs, bills, verses, balance-sheets 
With golden curls wrapt up in old receipts 
And love-letters &mdash; hides less than my sad brain, 
A pyramid, a vault that must contain 
More corpses than the public charnel stores.

I am a cemetery the moon abhors,
Where, like remorses, the long worms that trail
Always the dearest of my dead assail.
I am a boudoir full of faded roses
Where many an old outmoded dress reposes
And faded pastels and pale Bouchers only
Breathe a scent-flask, long-opened and left lonely...

Nothing can match those limping days for length 
Where under snows of years, grown vast in strength, 
Boredom (of listlessness the pale abortion) 
Of immortality takes the proportion!
&mdash; From henceforth, living matter, you are nought 
But stone surrounded by a dreadful thought: 
Lost in some dim Sahara, an old Sphinx, 
Of whom the world we live in never thinks. 
Lost on the map, it is its surly way 
Only to sing in sunset's fading ray.
