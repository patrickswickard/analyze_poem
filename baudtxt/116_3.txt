Beauty

I'm fair, O mortals, as a dream of stone; 
My breasts whereon, in turn, your wrecks you shatter,
Were made to wake in poets' hearts alone 
A love as indestructible as matter.

A sky-throned sphinx, unknown yet, I combine 
The cygnet's whiteness with a heart of snow. 
I loathe all movement that displaces line, 
And neither tears nor laughter do I know.

Poets before my postures, which I seem 
To learn from masterpieces, love to dream 
And there in austere thought consume their days.

I have, these docile lovers to subject, 
Mirrors that glorify all they reflect -- 
These eyes, great eyes, eternal in their blaze!
