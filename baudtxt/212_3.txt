Autumn Sonnet

Your eyes like crystal ask me, clear and mute, 
"in me, strange lover, what do you admire?" 
Be lovely: hush: my heart, whom all things tire 
Except the candour of the primal brute,

Would hide from you the secret burning it 
And its black legend written out in fire, 
O soother of the sleep that I respire! 
Passion I hate, and I am hurt by wit.

Let us love gently. In his lair laid low, 
Ambushed in shades, Love strings his fatal bow. 
I know his ancient arsenal complete,

Crime, horror, lunacy &mdash; O my pale daisy!
Are we not suns in Autumn, silver-hazy, 
O my so white, so snow-cold Marguerite?
