Heauton Timoroumenos

I mean to strike you without hate,
As butchers do; as Moses did
The rock. From under either lid
Your tears will flow to inundate

This huge Sahara which is I.
My heart, insensible with pain,
Caught in that flood will live again:
Will care whether it live or die &mdash; 

Will strive as in the salty sea,
Drunken with brine and all but drowned,
Yet driven onward by the sound
Of your wild sobbing endlessly!

For look &mdash; I am at war, my dear, 
With the whole universe. I know 
There is no medicine for my woe. 
Believe me, it is called Despair.

It runs in all my veins. I pray: 
It cries in all my words. I am 
The very glass where what I damn 
Leers and admires itself all day.

I am the wound &mdash; I am the knife 
The deep wound scabbards; the outdrawn 
Rack, and the writhing thereupon; 
The lifeless, and the taker of life.

I murder what I most adore, 
Laughing: I am indeed of those 
Condemned for ever without repose 
To laugh &mdash; but who can smile no more.
