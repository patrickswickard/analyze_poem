Sonnet

With her dresses undulating, pearly, 
Even walking one would think her dancing, 
Like those long serpents which holy charmers 
Move in harmony at the tips of their batons.

Like the dull sand and the blue of deserts, 
Unmoved alike by human pain, 
Like the long fabric of the swell of seas, 
She unfolds herself with indifference.

Her polished eyes are of delicious metals,
And in this strange, symbolic nature
Where virgin angel meets with ancient sphinx,

Where all is only gold and steel and light and diamonds, 
There shines for ever, like a useless star, 
The cold majesty of the sterile woman.
