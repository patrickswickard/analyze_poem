The Death of Artists

How many times must I shake my bauble and bells 
And kiss your low forehead, dismal caricature? 
To strike the target of mystic nature, 
How many javelins must I waste, O my quiver?

We shall wear out our souls in subtle schemes
And we shall demolish many an armature
Before contemplating the glorious Creature
For whom a tormenting desire makes our hearts grieve!

There are some who have never known their Idol
And those sculptors, damned and branded with shame,
Who are always hammering their brows and their breasts,

Have but one hope, bizarre and somber Capitol! 
It is that Death, soaring like a new sun, 
Will bring to bloom the flowers of their brains!
