Song of Autumn

I

Soon into frozen shades, like leaves, we'll tumble. 
Adieu, short summer's blaze, that shone to mock. 
I hear already the funereal rumble 
Of logs, as on the paving-stones they shock.

Winter will enter in my soul to dwell &mdash; 
Rage, hate, fear, horror, labour forced and dire! 
My heart will seem, to sun that polar hell, 
A dim, red, frozen block, devoid of fire.

Shuddering I hear the heavy thud of fuel. 
The building of a gallows sounds as good!
My spirit, like a tower, reels to the cruel 
Battering-ram in every crash of wood.

The ceaseless echoes rock me and appal. 
They're nailing up a coffin, I'll be bound, 
For whom? &mdash; Last night was Summer. Here's the Fall.
There booms a farewell volley in the sound.

II

I like die greenish light in your long eyes, 
Dear: but today all things are sour to me. 
And naught, your hearth, your boudoir, nor your sighs 
Are worth the sun that glitters on the sea.

Yet love me, tender heart, as mothers cherish 
A thankless wretch, Lover or sister, be 
Ephemeral sweetness of the suns that perish 
Or glory of the autumn swift to flee.

Brief task! The charnel yawns in hunger horrid, 
Yet let me with my head upon your knees, 
Although I mourn the summer, white and torrid 
Taste these last yellow rays before they freeze.
