The Venal Muse

Oh Muse of my heart -- so fond of palaces old, 
Wilt have -- when New-Year speeds its wintry blast, 
Amid those tedious nights, with snow o'ercast, 
A log to warm thy feet, benumbed with cold? 

Wilt thou thy marbled shoulders then revive 
With nightly rays that through thy shutters peep? 
And -- void thy purse and void thy palace -- reap 
A golden hoard within some azure hive? 

Thou must, to earn thy daily bread, each night, 
Suspend the censer like an acolyte, 
Te-Deums sing, with sanctimonious ease, 

Or as a famished mountebank, with jokes obscene 
Essay to lull the vulgar rabble's spleen;
Thy laughter soaked in tears which no one sees.
