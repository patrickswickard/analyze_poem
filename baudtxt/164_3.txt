The Red-Haired Beggar Girl

White girl with flame-red hair, 
Whose garments, here and there, 
Give poverty to view, 
And beauty too.

To me, poor puny poet, 
Your body, as you show it, 
With freckles on your arms, 
Has yet its charms.

You wear with prouder mien 
Than in Romance a queen 
Her velvet buskins could &mdash; 
Your clogs of wood.

In place of tatters short 
Let some rich robe of court 
Swirl with its silken wheels 
After your heels:

In place of stockings holed 
A dagger made of gold, 
To light the lecher's eye, 
Flash on your thigh:

Let ribbons slip their bows 
And for our sins disclose 
A breast whose radiance vies 
Even with your eyes.

To show them further charms
Let them implore your arms,
And these, rebuking, humble
Fingers that fumble

With proferred pearls aglow 
And sonnets of Belleau, 
Which, fettered by your beauty,
They yield in duty.

Riffraff of scullion-rhymers 
Would dedicate their primers 
Under the stairs to view
Only your shoe.

Each page-boy lucky-starred, 
Each marquis, each Ronsard 
Would hang about your bower
To while an hour.

You'd count, among your blisses, 
Than lilies far more kisses, 
And boast, among your flames,
Some royal names.

Yet now your beauty begs 
For scraps on floors, and dregs 
Else destined to the gutter,
As bread and butter.

You eye, with longing tense, 
Cheap gauds for thirty cents, 
Which, pardon me, these days
I cannot raise.

No scent, or pearl, or stone, 
But nothing save your own 
Thin nudity for dower,
Pass on, my flower!
