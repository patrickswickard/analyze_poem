The End of the Day

Under the wan, dejected skies,
Impudent, raucous, full of treason,
This life runs dancing without reason.
Voluptuous night begins to rise,

Appeasing even those who fast,
Ravenous hunger making tame,
And hiding all things, even shame,
Until the Poet says, "At last

My spirit, like my weary spine, 
Can do with slumber, that is certain, 
Sad dreams invade this heart of mine.

I'm off to lie down on my back, 
And roll myself into your curtain, 
Refreshing shadows, dense and black!"
