Abel and Cain

I

Race of Abel, eat, sleep and drink;
God smiles on you approvingly.

Race of Cain, in filth and stink
Grovel and die, miserably.

Race of Abel, your offering
Flatters the angelic nose !

Race of Cain, what time will bring
The end of your torment and woes ?

Race of Abel, your seeds take root,
And see how all your cattle prosper;

Race of Cain, within your gut
Howls hunger like an ancient cur.

Race of Abel, your innards take
Warmth from the patriarchal hearth;

Race of Cain, poor jackal, shake
With cold, crouched in the hollowed earth !

Race of Abel, make love and spawn !
Your gold spawns also in its right.

Race of Cain, you hearts that burn,
Beware of such great appetite.

Race of Abel, you browse and breed
As wanton as an orchard pest.

Race of Cain, along the roadside
Drag your family, hard pressed.

II

Ah ! race of Abel, your fat carcass
Will enrich the reeking soil !

Race of Cain, your hard work is
Not finished yet in spite of all;

Race of Abel, here your shame lies :
The sword lost to the hunter’s rod !

Race of Cain, mount to the skies
And down upon the earth cast God !
