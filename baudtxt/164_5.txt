To a Red-Haired Beggar Girl

Little white girl with red hair, 
The holes in your frock
Show poverty
And beauty,

For me, a poor poet, 
Your young and ailing body, 
Spotted with, freckles,
Has its sweetness.

You carry more gallantly, 
Than can a queen of fiction 
Her high-boots of velvet,
Your heavy clogs.

In place of rags too short for you, 
May a fine court costume 
Be drawn in blustering, long folds
At your heels;

In place of stockings in holes, 
May a dagger of gold 
Glitter for the eyes of rakes
On your leg;

May barely fastened knots 
Reveal for our sinning 
Your lovely breasts, radiant
As two eyes;

May, to undress yourself,
Your arms require coaxing
And may they archly repel
Mischievous fingers,

May pearls of finest water, 
Sonnets by Belleau, 
Be ceaselessly proffered
By your enslaved lovers,

Trains of servant rhymers, 
Dedicating first lines to you 
And watching your slipper
Under the staircase,

Many a flunkey struck at random, 
Many a lord and many a Ronsard 
Would spy to seduce it
Your tender retreat!

You would count more kisses 
Than lilies in your beds 
And you would hold in sway
More than one Valois!

 &mdash; Meanwhile you go begging 
Some old rubbish lying 
On the threshold of some
Vulgar V&eacute;four;

You go gaping past your shoulder 
At twenty-nine sou jewels 
Of which, I cannot, I am sorry,
Make a gift to you.

Go then, without other ornament, 
Perfume, pearls or diamonds, 
Than your emaciated nudity,
O my beauty!
