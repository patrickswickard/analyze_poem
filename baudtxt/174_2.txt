Sadness of the Moon

Tonight the moon dreams with more indolence, 
Like a lovely woman on a bed of cushions 
Who fondles with a light and listless hand 
The contour of her breasts before falling asleep;

On the satiny back of the billowing clouds,
Languishing, she lets herself fall into long swoons 
And casts her eyes over the white phantoms 
That rise in the azure like blossoming flowers.

When, in her lazy listlessness,
She sometimes sheds a furtive tear upon this globe,
A pious poet, enemy of sleep,

In the hollow of his hand catches this pale tear, 
With the iridescent reflections of opal, 
And hides it in his heart afar from the sun's eyes.
