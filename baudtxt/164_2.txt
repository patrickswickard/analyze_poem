To an Auburn-Haired Beggar-Maid

Pale girl with the auburn hair,
Whose dress through its tears and holes
Reveals your poverty
And your beauty,

For me, an ailing poet,
Your body, young and sickly,
Spotted with countless freckles,
Has its sweetness.

You wear with more elegance
Your wooden clogs than the queen
In a romance her sandals
Trimmed with velvet.

Instead of a scanty rag,
Let a glittering court dress
Trail with its long, rustling folds
Over your heels;

In place of stockings with holes, 
Let, for the eyes of rou&eacute;s, 
A golden poniard glisten
In your garter;

Let ill-tied ribbons give way 
And unveil, so we may sin, 
Your two lovely breasts, radiant
As shining eyes;

Let your arms demand entreating 
To uncover your body 
And repel with saucy blows
Roguish fingers,

Pearls of the finest water, 
Sonnets by Master Belleau
Constantly offered by swains
Held in love's chains,

Plebeian versifiers 
Offering first books to you 
And ogling your slippered foot
From under the stair;

Many a page fond of love's chance, 
Many a Ronsard and lord 
For amusement would spy on
Your chilly hut!

You could count in your beds
More kisses than fleurs-de-lis
And subject to your power
Many Valois!

&mdash; However, you go begging 
Some moldy refuse lying 
On the steps of some V&eacute;four
At the crossroads;

You go furtively eyeing 
Baubles at twenty-nine sous, 
Of which I can't, oh! pardon! 
Make you a gift.

Go, with no more adornment, 
Perfume or pearl or diamond, 
Than your slender nudity, 
O my beauty!
