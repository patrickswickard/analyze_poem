The Gypsies

They set out yesterday, the tribe of ragged seers 
With burning eyes -- bearing their little ones in nests 
Upon their backs, or giving them, to stop their tears, 
The teats of inexhaustible and swarthy breasts.

The men walk shouldering their rifles silently 
Beside the hooded wagons with bright tatters hung, 
And peer into the sky, as if they hoped to see 
Some old mirage that beckoned them when they were young.

No matter where they journey through the meager land, 
The cricket will sing louder from his lair of sand, 
And Cybele, who loves them, will smile where they advance:

The desert will be fruitful, the arid rock will flow 
Before the footsteps of these wayfarers, who go 
Eternally into the lightless realm of chance.
