Destruction

Always the Demon fidgets here beside me 
And swims around, impalpable as air: 
I drink him, feel him burn the lungs inside me 
With endless evil longings and despair.

Sometimes, knowing my love of Art, he uses 
Seductive forms of women: and has thus, 
With specious, hypocritical excuses, 
Accustomed me to philtres infamous.

Leading me wayworn into wastes untrod
Of boundless Boredom, out of sight of God,
Using all baits to compass my abduction,

Into my eyes, confused and full of woe, 
Soiled clothes and bleeding gashes he will throw 
And all the grim regalia of Destruction.
