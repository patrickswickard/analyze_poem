Le Revenant

Like the mild-eyed angels sweet 
I will come to thy retreat, 
Stealing in without a sound 
When the shades of night close round. 

I will give thee manifold 
Kisses soft and moony-cold, 
Gliding, sliding o'er thee like 
A serpent crawling round a dike. 

When the livid morn creeps on 
You will wake and find me gone 
Till the evening come again. 

As by tenderness and ruth 
Others rule thy life and youth, 
I by terror choose to reign.
