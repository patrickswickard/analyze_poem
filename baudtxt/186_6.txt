The Metamorphoses of the Vampire

Then the woman with the strawberry mouth,
Squirming like a snake upon the coals,
Kneading her breasts against the iron of her corset,
Let flow these words scented with musk:
 &mdash; "I have wet lips, and I know the art
Of losing old conscience in the depths of a bed.
I dry all tears on my triumphing breasts
And I make old men laugh with the laughter of children.
For those who see me naked, without any covering,
I am the moon and the sun and the sky and the stars!
I am so dexterous in voluptuous love, my dear, my wise one,
When I strangle a man in my dreadful arms,
Or abandon my breast to his biting,
So shy and lascivious, so frail and vigorous,
That on these cushions that swoon with passion
The powerless angels damn their souls for me!"

When she had sucked the pith from my bones 
And, drooping, I turned towards her 
To give her the kiss of love, I saw only 
An old leather bottle with sticky sides and full of pus! 
I shut both eyes in cold dismay 
And when I opened them both to clear reality, 
By my side, instead of that powerful puppet 
Which seemed to have taken some lease of blood, 
There shook vaguely the remains of a skeleton, 
Which itself gave the cry of a weathercock 
Or of a sign-board, at the end of a rod of iron, 
Which the wind swings in winter nights.
