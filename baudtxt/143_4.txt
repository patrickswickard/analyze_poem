The Perfume Flask

All matter becomes porous to certain scents; they pass
Through everything; it seems they even go through glass.
When opening some old trunk brought home from the far east,
That scolds, feeling the key turned and the lid released &mdash; 

Some wardrobe, in a house long uninhabited, 
Full of the powdery odors of moments that are dead &mdash; 
At times, distinct as ever, an old flask will emit 
Its perfume; and a soul comes back to live in it.

Dormant as chrysalides, a thousand thoughts that lie 
In the thick shadows, pulsing imperceptibly, 
Now stir, now struggle forth; now their cramped wings unfold, 
Tinted with azure, lustred with rose, sheeted with gold!

Oh, memories, how you rise and soar, and hover there!
The eyes close; dizziness, in the moth-darkened air,
Seizes the drunken soul, and thrusts it toward the verge &mdash; 
Where mistily all human miasmas float and merge &mdash; 

Of a primeval gulf; and drops it to the ground, 
There, where, like Lazarus rising, his grave-clothes half unwound, 
And odorous, a cadaver from its sleep has stirred: 
An old and rancid love, charming and long-interred.

Thus, when I shall be lost from sight, thus when all men
Forget me, in the dark and dusty corner then
Of that most sinister cupboard where the living pile
The dead &mdash; when, an old flask, cracked, sticky, abject, vile,

I lie at length &mdash; still, still, sweet pestilence of my heart, 
As to what power thou hast, how virulent thou art, 
I shall bear witness; safe shall thy dear poison be! 
Thou vitriol of the gods! thou death and life of me!
