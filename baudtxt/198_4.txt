The Death of the Poor

Death? Death is our one comfort! -- is the bread whereby 
We live, the wine that warms us when all hope is gone; 
The very goal of Life. That we shall one day die: 
This is the thought which gives us courage to go on.

Clear on the black horizon, through the blinding sleet, 
That beacon burns; -- oh, Death, thou inn of wide renown! 
Is it not written in the book: "Here all may eat; 
Here there is rest for all; here all may sit them down?"

Thou hovering Angel, holding in thy magic hand 
Slumber and blissful dreams; thou Glory overhead; 
Mysterious attic, filled with treasures manifold;

The poor man's purse, and his remembered fatherland; 
Thou, that remakest nightly the beggar's crumpled bed; 
Thou only door ajar, pledge of the peace foretold!
