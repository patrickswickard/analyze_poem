III Luck

So huge a burden to support 
Your courage, Sisyphus, would ask; 
Well though my heart attacks its task, 
Yet Art is long and Time is short.

Far from the famed memorial arch 
Towards a lonely grave I come. 
My heart in its funereal march 
Goes beating like a muffled drum.

&mdash; Yet many a gem lies hidden still 
Of whom no pick-axe, spade, or drill 
The lonely secrecy invades;

And many a flower, to heal regret, 
Pours forth its fragrant secret yet 
Amidst the solitary shades.
