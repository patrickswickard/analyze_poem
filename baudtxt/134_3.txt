<i>For You This Poem: If My Name Should Reach</i>

For you this poem: if my name should reach
Favoured by mighty gales, to far-off times,
Like a proud vessel sailing to the beach,
To stir the brains of humans with my rhymes -- 

Your memory, uncertain as a myth, 
Will tire the reader like an endless gong, 
And be a mystic, kindred chain wherewith 
He'll hang suspended to my towering song:

Curs'd soul to whom (from the supernal sky
To hell's abysm) none responds but I!
O you, who like a fleeting shadow pass,

Spurn with light foot and with serenest gaze 
The stupid mortals who have grudged you praise, 
O jade-eyed statue, angel browed with brass!
