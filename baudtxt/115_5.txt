The Chastisement of Pride

In those old times wherein Theology 
Flourished with greater sap and energy, 
A celebrated doctor &mdash; so they say &mdash; 
Having stirred many careless hearts one day 
Down to their dullest depths, and having shown 
Strange pathways leading to the heavenly throne &mdash; 
Tracks he himself had never journeyed on 
(Whereby maybe pure spirits alone had gone) &mdash; 
Frenzied and swollen by a devilish pride, 
Like to a man who has climbed too high, outcried: 
"Ah, little Jesus, I have lifted thee! 
But had I willed to assault thy dignity, 
Thy shame had matched thy present fame, and lo! 
Thou wouldst be but a wretched embryo!"

Straightway his reason left him; that keen mind, 
Sunbright before, was darkened and made blind; 
All chaos whirled within that intellect 
Erewhile a shrine with all fair gems bedeckt. 
Beneath whose roof such pomp had shone so bright; 
He was possessed by silence and thick night 
As is a cellar when its key is lost 

Thenceforth he was a brute beast; when he crossed 
The fields at times, not seeing any thing. 
Knowing not if 'twere winter or green spring, 
Useless, repulsive, vile, he made a mock 
For infants, a mere children's laughing-stock.
