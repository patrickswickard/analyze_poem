Metamorphoses of the Vampire

Meanwhile from her red mouth the woman, in husky tones,
Twisting her body like a serpent upon hot stones
And straining her white breasts from their imprisonment,
Let fall these words, as potent as a heavy scent:
"My lips are moist and yielding, and I know the way
To keep the antique demon of remorse at bay.
All sorrows die upon my bosom. I can make
Old men laugh happily as children for my sake.
For him who sees me naked in my tresses, I
Replace the sun, the moon, and all the stars of the sky!
Believe me, learn&egrave;d sir, I am so deeply skilled
That when I wind a lover in my soft arms, and yield
My breasts like two ripe fruits for his devouring &mdash; both
Shy and voluptuous, insatiable and loath &mdash; 
Upon this bed that groans and sighs luxuriously
Even the impotent angels would be damned for me!"

When she had drained me of my very marrow, and cold 
And weak, I turned to give her one more kiss &mdash; behold, 
There at my side was nothing but a hideous 
Putrescent thing, all faceless and exuding pus.
I closed my eyes and mercifully swooned till day: 
And when I looked at morning for that beast of prey 
Who seemed to have replenished her arteries from my own, 
The wan, disjointed fragments of a skeleton 
Wagged up and down in a lewd posture where she had lain, 
Rattling with each convulsion like a weathervane 
Or an old sign that creaks upon its bracket, right 
Mournfully in the wind upon a winter's night.
