The Clock

Terrible Clock! God without mercy; mighty Power! 
Saying all day, "<i>Remember!</i> Remember and beware: 
There is no arrow of pain but in a tiny hour 
Will make thy heart its target, and stick and vibrate there.

"Toward the horizon all too soon and out of sight 
Vaporous Pleasure, like a sylphide, floats away; 
Each instant swallows up one crumb of that delight 
Accorded to each man for all his mortal day."

The Second says, three thousand six hundred times an hour, 
<i>"Remember!</i> Look, the wing&egrave;d insect Now doth sit 
Upon thy vein, and shrilleth, 'I am Nevermore, 
And I have sucked thy blood; I am flying away with it!'

<i>"Remember! Souviens-toi! Esto memor!</i> -- no tongue
My metal larynx does not speak -- O frivolous man,
These minutes, rich in gold, slide past; thou art not young;
<i>Remember!</i> and wash well the gravel in the pan!

<i>"Remember!</i> Time, the player that need not cheat to win, 
Makes a strong adversary. Is thy game begun? 
Thy game is lost! Day wanes; night waxes. Look within 
The gulf, -- it still is thirsty. The sands are all but run.

"Soon, soon, the hour will strike, when Hazard, he that showed 
A god-like face, when Virtue -- thy bride, but still intact -- 
When even Repentance (oh, last inn along the road!) 
Will say to thee, 'Die, coward. It is too late to act.'"
