The Old Servant

The servant that we had, you were so jealous of, 
I think we might at least lay flowers on her grave. 
Good creature, she's beneath the sod... and we're above; 
The dead, poor things, what valid grievances they have! 
And, when October comes, stripping the wood of leaves, 
And round their marble slabs the wind of autumn grieves, 
Surely, a living man must seem to the cold dead 
Somewhat unfeeling, sound asleep in his warm bed, 
While, gnawed by blacker dreams than any we have known -- 
Lovers, good conversation, every pleasure gone -- 
Old bones concerning which the worm has had his say, 
They feel the heavy snows of winter drip away, 
And years go by, and no one from the sagging vase 
Lifts the dried flowers to put fresh flowers in their place.

Some evening, when the whistling log begins to purr,
Supposing, in that chair, appeared the ghost of her;
Supposing, on some cold and blue December night,
I found her in my room, humble, half out of sight,
And thoughtful, having come from her eternal bed 
To shield her grown-up child, to soothe his troubled head, 
What could I find to say to the poor faithful soul, -- 
Seeing the tears beneath those sunken eyelids roll?
