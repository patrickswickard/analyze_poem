Une Nuit Que J'&eacute;tais Pr&egrave;s d'une Affreuse Juive

A hideous Jewess lay with me for hire 
One night: two corpses side by side we seemed 
And stretched by that polluted thing I dreamed 
Of the sad beauty of my vain desire. 

I thought upon her brow clad round with fire 
And matchless strength, her native majesty, 
Her perfumed helm of hair whose memory 
Makes me toward Love's heights to reaspire. 

For fervently I would have rained, my Sweet, 
Fond kisses over all thy form divine 
Even from thy black tresses to thy feet, 

If some soft evening, with a single tear, 
O cruel queen, thou couldst have dimmed the clear 
Cold splendour of those icy eyes of thine.
