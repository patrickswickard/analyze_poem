Invitation to the Voyage

Think, would it not be
Sweet to live with me
All alone, my child, my love? &mdash; 
Sleep together, share
All things, in that fair
Country you remind me of? 
Charming in the dawn 
There, the half-withdrawn
Drenched, mysterious sun appears 
In the curdled skies, 
Treacherous as your eyes
Shining from behind their tears.

There, restraint and order bless
Luxury and voluptuousness.

We should have a room 
Never out of bloom:
Tables polished by the palm 
Of the vanished hours 
Should reflect rare flowers
In that amber-scented calm;
Ceilings richly wrought,
Mirrors deep as thought,
Walls with eastern splendor hung,
All should speak apart 
To the homesick heart
In its own dear native tongue.

There, restraint and order bless
Luxury and voluptuousness.

See, their voyage past,
To their moorings fast,
On the still canals asleep, 
These big ships; to bring 
You some trifling thing
They have braved the furious deep.
&mdash; Now the sun goes down,
Tinting dyke and town,
Field, canal, all things in sight,
Hyacinth and gold;
All that we behold
Slumbers in its ruddy light.

There, restraint and order bless
Luxury and voluptuousness.
