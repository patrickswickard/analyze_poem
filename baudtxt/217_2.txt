Reflected Horror

From that sky, bizarre and livid, 
Distorted as your destiny, 
What thoughts into your empty soul 
Descend? Answer me, libertine.

&mdash; Insatiably avid 
For the dark and the uncertain, 
I shall not whimper like Ovid 
Chased from his Latin paradise.

Skies torn like the shores of the sea,
You are the mirror of my pride;
Your vast clouds in mourning

Are the black hearses of my dreams, 
And your gleams are the reflection 
Of the Hell which delights my heart.
