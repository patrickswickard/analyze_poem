Invitation to the Voyage

My daughter, my sister, 
Consider the vista 
Of living out there, you and I,
To love at our leisure, 
Then, ending our pleasure, 
In climes you resemble to die. 
There the suns, rainy-wet, 
Through clouds rise and set 
With the selfsame enchantment to charm me 
That my senses receive 
From your eyes, that deceive, 
When they shine through your tears to disarm me.

There'll be nothing but beauty, wealth, pleasure, 
With all things in order and measure.

With old treasures furnished, 
By centuries burnished, 
To gleam in the shade of our chamber, 
While the rarest of flowers 
Vaguely mix through the hours 
Their own with the perfume of amber: 
Each sumptuous ceiling, 
Each mirror revealing 
The wealth of the East, will be hung 
So the part and the whole 
May speak to the soul 
In its native, indigenous tongue.

There'll be nothing but beauty, wealth, pleasure, 
With all things in order and measure.

On the channels and streams 
See each vessel that dreams 
In its whimsical vagabond way, 
Since its for your least whim 
The oceans they swim 
From the ends of the night and the day. 
The sun, going down, With its glory will crown 
Canals, fields, and cities entire, 
While the whole earth is rolled 
In the jacinth and gold 
Of its warming and radiant fire.

There'll be nothing but beauty, wealth, pleasure 
With all things in order and measure.
