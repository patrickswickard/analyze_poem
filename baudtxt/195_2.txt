The Wine of the Solitary

The strange look of a lady of pleasure 
Turned slyly toward us like the white beam 
Which the undulous moon casts on the trembling lake 
When she wishes to bathe her nonchalant beauty;

The last bag of crowns between a gambler's fingers;
A lustful kiss from slender Adeline;
The sound of music, tormenting and caressing,
Resembling the distant cry of a man in pain,

All that is not worth, O deep, deep bottle, 
The penetrating balm that your fruitful belly 
Holds for the thirsty heart of the pious poet;

You pour out for him hope, and youth, and life
-- And pride, the treasure of all beggary,
Which makes us triumphant and equal to the gods!
