The Venal Muse

Muse of my heart, of palaces the lover, 
Where will you, when the blast of winter blows
In the black boredom of snowed lights, discover 
A glowing brand to warm your violet toes?

How will you there revive your marbled skin 
At the chill rays your shutters then disperse? 
The gold of azure heavens will you win 
When empty are your palate and your purse?

You'll need each evening, then, to earn your bread, 
As choirboys swinging censers that are dead 
Who sing Te Deums which they disbelieve:

Or, fasting pierrette, trade your loveliness 
And laughter, soaked in tears that none can guess, 
The boredom of the vulgar to relieve.
