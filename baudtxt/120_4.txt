Exotic Perfume

On autumn nights, eyes closed, when, sensuous,
I breathe the scent of your warm breasts, my sight
Is peopled by far shores, happy and bright,
Under a sun, warm and monotonous.
A lazy isle which nature, generous,
Stocks with weird trees and fruits of strange delight,
Men with lithe bodies, powerful but slight,
Women whose candid eyes flash luminous.

Urged by your scent to such charmed lands at last, 
I see a port with many a sail and mast 
Still weary from the ocean's frenzied roll, 
While the green tamarinds exhale their savor 
To please my nostrils with a dulcet flavor, 
Mingled with sailor chanteys in my soul.
