<i>What Shall You Say Tonight?</i>

What shall you say tonight, poor soul so full of care, 
What shall you say, my heart, heart hitherto so sad, 
To the most kind, to the most dear, to the most fair, 
Whose pure serene regard has made you proud and glad?

-- We shall set all our pride to sing her holy praise!
What sweetness to be hers! To live beneath her sight! 
Half spirit is her flesh, angelic all her ways; 
Her glance alone invests us in a robe of light!

Whether in solitude and deep obscurity, 
Whether by day among the moving crowd it be, 
Her phantom like a torch in air will dance and run;

It speaks: "Beauty is mine; Authority is mine; 
Love only, for my sake, the noble and the fine: 
I am thine Angel, Muse, Madonna, all in one."
