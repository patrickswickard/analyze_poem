Beauty

I arn lovely, O mortals, like a dream of stone, 
And my bosom, where each one gets bruised in turn, 
To inspire the love of a poet is prone, 
Like matter eternally silent and stern. 

As an unfathomed sphinx, enthroned by the Nile, 
My heart a swan's whiteness with granite combines, 
And I hate every movement, displacing the lines, 
And never I weep and never I smile. 

The poets in front of mine attitudes fine 
(Which the proudest of monuments seem to implant), 
To studies profound all their moments assign, 

For I have all these docile swains to enchant &mdash;
Two mirrors, which Beauty in all things ignite: 
Mine eyes, my large eyes, of eternal Light!
