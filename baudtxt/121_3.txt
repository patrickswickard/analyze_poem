<i>More Than Night's Vault, It's You That I Adore</i>

More than night's vault, it's you that I adore, 
Vessel of sorrow, silent one, the more 
Because you flee from me, and seem to place, 
Ornament of my nights! more leagues of space 
Ironically between me and you 
Than part me from these vastitudes of blue.

I charge, attack, and mount to the assault
As worms attack a corpse within a vault.
And cherish even the coldness that you boast,
By which, harsh beast, you subjugate me most.
