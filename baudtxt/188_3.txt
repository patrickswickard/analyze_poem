Love and the Skull

(Old Tail-piece)

With bold and insolent grimace, 
Love laughingly bestrides 
The bare skull of the Human Race, 
And, as enthroned he rides, 
Blows bubbles from his rosy cheek 
Which soar into the sky 
As if, beyond the blue, to seek 
The other worlds on high. 
They ride with wondrous verve at first, 
Reflect the sunny beams, 
Then spit their flimsy souls, to burst 
And fade like golden dreams. 
I hear the skull at each renewal 
Expostulate aghast &mdash; 
"This game, ridiculous and cruel &mdash; 
When will it end at last? 
For what your cruel mouthpiece drains 
And scatters, sud by sud, 
Monstrous Assassin! is my brains, 
My substance, and my blood."
