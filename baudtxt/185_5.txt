Beatrice

In a burned-over land, where not a blade or leaf 
Showed green, through a charred world, whetting my ancient grief 
Slowly upon my heart, and making sad lament 
To Nature, at broad noon, not knowing where I went, 
I walked... and saw above me a big cloud &mdash; which at first 
I took to be a storm &mdash; blacken, and swell and burst, 
And pour upon my head instead of rain a rout 
Of demons, dwarfed and cruel, which ringed me all about. 
As passersby, no matter upon what errands bent, 
Will always stop and stare with cold astonishment 
At some poor man gone mad, then bait him wittily, 
Just so they gaped and nudged, and jeered aloud at me.

&mdash; "Come! Have a look at this! What is it, should you say?
The shade of Hamlet &mdash; why, of course! &mdash; look at the way
He stands! &mdash; that undecided eye! &mdash; the wild hair, too!
Come here! Do look! Oh, wouldn't it wring a tear from you!
This shabby bon-vivant, this pompous tramp, this ham-
Actor out of a job, thinking that he can cram,
By ranting, stale gesticulations, crocodile-tears,
His tragic fate into the ears of crickets, into the ears
Of eagles! &mdash; yes, who knows? &mdash; along with brooks and flowers
Forgetting we invented these tricks, even into ours!"

But for one thing &mdash; no mountain is taller than my pride; 
No demon horde can scale me &mdash; I could have turned aside 
My sovereign thought, and stood alone... had I not seen 
Suddenly, amongst this loathsome troupe, <i>her,</i> my heart's queen &mdash; 
And the sun did not reel, it stood unmoved above! &mdash; 
Her of the pure deep gaze, my life, my peerless love, 
Mocking and pointing, laughing at my acute distress; 
Or fondling some foul dwarf in an obscene caress.
