<i>Now the Great-Hearted Servant, Who Aroused</i>

Now the great-hearted servant, who aroused 
Your jealousy, in humble earth is housed, 
Let's take, at least, some flowers for her relief. 
The dead, the piteous dead, know piercing grief, 
And when October blows, to prune old trees, 
And whistles round the marble where they freeze, 
How thankless then we living must appear 
Between warm sheets to sleep in comfort here, 
While, eaten by black dreams, they lie in woe 
Warm bedmates and their gossip to forego, 
Frostbitten skeletons, tunneled by vermin, 
To bear the moulting drip of Winter's ermine, 
For ages, with no friends nor kindred there 
The tatters on their railings to repair.

On evenings when the hearthlogs hiss and flare 
Were I to see her calmly take her chair: 
Or, in the calm and blue December gloom, 
Huddle within the corner of my room, 
Gravely returning from her bed eternal 
To tend this grown-up child with the maternal 
Care of old times &mdash; how could I then reply 
To see the tears roll from each hollow eye?
