The Possessed

The sun in crepe has muffled up his fire. 
Moon of my life! Half shade yourself like him. 
Slumber or smoke. Be silent and be dim, 
And in the gulf of boredom plunge entire;

I love you thus! However, if you like, 
Like some bright star from its eclipse emerging, 
To flaunt with Folly where the crowds are surging -- 
Flash, lovely dagger, from your sheath and strike!

Light up your eyes from chandeliers of glass! 
Light up the lustful looks of louts that pass! 
Morbid or petulant, I thrill before you.

Be what you will, black night or crimson dawn;
No fibre of my body tautly-drawn,
But cries: "Beloved demon, I adore you!"
