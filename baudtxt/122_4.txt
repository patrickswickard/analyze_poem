Tyranny of Woman

Aye, you would bed with the whole universe, 
Lewd woman! Ennui makes your soul perverse; 
Cruel, you whet your teeth at this weird play, 
You need a fresh heart in the rack each day. 
Your eyes blaze like illumined shops or lights 
Of serried lamps on festive public nights,
They use a borrowed puissance haughtily 
Unconscious of their beauty's tyranny.

Blind, deaf machine, geared to increase man's pain, 
Tool primed to suckle blood from his last vein, 
Have you no shame when every looking glass 
Betrays your faded beauties as you pass, 
When cunning Nature's hidden plans begin 
To use you, beast! woman, vile queen of sin, 
To fashion genius in carnality?

O shameless might! Sublime ignominy!
