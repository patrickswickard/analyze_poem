<i>What Can You Say, Poor Lonely Soul of Mine</i>

What can you say, poor lonely soul of mine, 
Or you, poor heart, so long ago turned sour, 
To the best, dearest, loveliest, whose divine 
Regard has made you open like a flower?

We'll set our pride to sing her highest praise 
Naught to her sweet authority compares: 
Her psychic flesh is formed of fragrant airs. 
Her glances clothe us in a suit of rays.

Be it in solitude at dead of night, 
Or in the crowded streets of glaring light, 
Her phantom like a torch before me streams.

It speaks: "I'm beautiful. These orders take.
Love naught but Beauty, always, for my sake,
Madonna, guardian Angel, Muse of dreams."
