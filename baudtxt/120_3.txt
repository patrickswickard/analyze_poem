Exotic Perfume

When I, with eyes shut, on warm autumn eves, 
The fragrance of your warmer breast respire, 
I see a country bathed in solar fire 
Whose happy shores its lustre never leaves;

An isle of indolence, where nature raises 
Singular trees and fruits both sweet and tender, 
Where men have bodies vigorous and slender 
And women's eyes a candour that amazes.

Led by your scent to fairer climes at last, 
I see a port of sails, where every mast 
Seems weary of the labours of its cruise;

While scents of tamarind, blown here and there, 
Swelling my nostrils as they rinse the air, 
Are mingled with the chanties of the crews.
