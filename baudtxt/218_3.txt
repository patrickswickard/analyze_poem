The Clock

The Clock, calm evil god, that makes us shiver, 
With threatening finger warns us each apart:
<i>"Remember!</i> Soon the vibrant woes will quiver, 
Like arrows in a target, in your heart.

To the horizon Pleasure will take flight 
As flits a vaporous sylphide to the wings. 
Each instant gnaws a crumb of the delight 
That for his season every mortal brings.

Three thousand times and more, each hour, the second 
Whispers <i>'Remember!'</i> Like an insect shrill 
The present chirps, 'With Nevermore I'm reckoned, 
I've pumped your lifeblood with my loathsome bill.'

<i>Remember! Souviens-toi I Esto Memor!</i> 
My brazen windpipe speaks in every tongue. 
Each moment, foolish mortal, is like ore 
From which the precious metal must be wrung.

<i>Remember.</i> Time the gamester (it's the law) 
Wins always, without cheating. Daylight wanes. 
Night deepens. The abyss with gulfy maw 
Thirsts on unsated, while the hour-glass drains.

Sooner or later, now, the time must be 
When Hazard, Virtue (your still-virgin mate), 
Repentance, (your last refuge), or all three &mdash; 
Will tell you, 'Die, old Coward. It's too late!'"
