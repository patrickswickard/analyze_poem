The Ideal

It's not with smirking beauties of vignettes, 
The shopsoiled products of a worthless age, 
With buskined feet and hands for castanets &mdash; 
A heart like mine its longing could assuage.

I leave Gavarni, poet of chloroses, 
His twittering flock, anaemic and unreal. 
I could not find among such bloodless roses, 
A flower to match my crimson-hued ideal.

To this heart deeper than the deepest canyon,
Lady Macbeth would be a fit companion,
Crime-puissant dream of Aeschylus; or you,

Daughter of Buonarroti, stately Night!
Whose charms to suit a Titan's appetite,
You twist, so strange, yet peaceful, to the view.
