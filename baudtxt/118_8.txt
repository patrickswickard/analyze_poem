The Giantess

When Nature in her lavish lustiness 
Bred day by day new, strange monstrosities, 
Would I had lived with a young giantess 
Like a warm cat who at a queen's feet lies. 

'Twere sweet to watch her soul and body blossom 
While she disported her in terrible wise; 
To guess if a fierce flame burnt in her bosom 
By the wet mists that swam within her eyes. 

Ah! freely o'er her mighty limbs to run, 
To crawl upon the bend of her vast knees, 
And when in summer, tired of the pestilent sun, 

Across the plain she stretches calm and still, 
Within her breasts' cool shade to sleep at ease 
Like some small hamlet sheltered by a hill.
