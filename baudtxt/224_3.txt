A Passer-by

The deafening street roared on. Full, slim, and grand 
In mourning and majestic grief, passed down 
A woman, lifting with a stately hand 
And swaying the black borders of her gown;

Noble and swift, her leg with statues matching; 
I drank, convulsed, out of her pensive eye, 
A livid sky where hurricanes were hatching, 
Sweetness that charms, and joy that makes one die.

A lighting-flash &mdash; then darkness! Fleeting chance 
Whose look was my rebirth &mdash; a single glance! 
Through endless time shall I not meet with you?

Far off! too late! or never! &mdash; I not knowing
Who you may be, nor you where I am going &mdash; 
You, whom I might have loved, who know it too!
