Spiritual Dawn

When in the company of the Ideal 
(That gnawing tooth) Dawn enters, white and pink, 
The rooms of rakes &mdash; each sated beast can feel 
An Angel waking through the fumes of drink.

For downcast Man, who dreams and suffers still, 
The azure of the mystic heaven above, 
With gulf-like vertigo, attracts his will. 
So, Goddess, lucid Being of pure love,

Over the smoking wreck of feasts and scandals, 
Your phantom, rosy and enchanting, flies 
And still returns to my dilated eyes.

The sun has blackened out the flame of candles. 
So your victorious phantom seems as one, 
O blazing spirit, with the deathless Sun!
