Late January

Pluviose, hating all that lives, and loathing me, 
Distills his cold and gloomy rain and slops it down 
Upon the pallid lodgers in the cemetery 
Next door, and on the people shopping in the town.

My cat, for sheer discomfort, waves a sparsely-furred 
And shabby tail incessantly on the tiled floor; 
And, wandering sadly in the rain-spout, can be heard 
The voice of some dead poet who had these rooms before.

The log is wet, and smokes; its hissing high lament
Mounts to the bronchial clock on the cracked mantel there;
While (heaven knows whose they were &mdash; some dropsical old maid's)

In a soiled pack of cards that reeks of dirty scent, 
The handsome jack of hearts and the worn queen of spades 
Talk in suggestive tones of their old love-affair.
