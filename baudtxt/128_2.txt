The Vampire

You who, like the stab of a knife,
Entered my plaintive heart;
You who, strong as a herd
Of demons, came, ardent and adorned,

To make your bed and your domain
Of my humiliated mind
&mdash; Infamous bitch to whom I'm bound
Like the convict to his chain,

Like the stubborn gambler to the game, 
Like the drunkard to his wine, 
Like the maggots to the corpse,
&mdash; Accurst, accurst be you!

I begged the swift poniard 
To gain for me my liberty, 
I asked perfidious poison 
To give aid to my cowardice.

Alas! both poison and the knife
Contemptuously said to me:
"You do not deserve to be freed
From your accursed slavery,

Fool! &mdash; if from her domination
Our efforts could deliver you,
Your kisses would resuscitate
The cadaver of your vampire!"
