Mist and Rain

O Autumns, Winters, Springs! Seasons of mire! 
Soul-drowsing times! I love you. Take my praise 
For shrouding thus my heart and brain entire 
In a vague tomb and winding-sheet of haze.

Through the long nights when the south-wester swings 
The rusty vanes that shriek upon the towers, 
My soul can fully stretch its raven wings 
More easily than in the warmer hours.

Nothing is sweeter to funereal hearts 
On whom the frost of ages has been laid &mdash; 
Wan seasons, when you queen it round these parts, &mdash; 

Than the eternal sight of your pale shade: 
Unless on moonless midnights, pair by pair, 
To lull, upon chance beds, our hearts' despair.
