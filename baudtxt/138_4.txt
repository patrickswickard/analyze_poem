A Girl Too Gay

Oh, you are lovely! Every heart 
Surrenders to your sorceries; 
And laughter, like a playful breeze, 
Is always blowing your lips apart.

Your health is radiant, infinite,
Superb: When you go down the street
Each mournful passerby you meet
Is dazzled by the blaze of it!

Your startling dresses, overwrought 
With rainbow hues and sequined showers, 
Bring to a poet's mind the thought 
Of a ballet of drunken flowers.

They are the very symbol of
Your gay and crudely colored soul,
As strip&egrave;d as a barber's pole,
Exuberant thing I hate and love!

Sometimes when wandering, full of gloom,
In a bright garden, I have felt
Horror for all I touched and smelt:
The world outrageously in bloom,

The blinding yellow sun, the spring's 
Raw verdure so rebuked my woes 
That I have punished upon a rose 
The insolence of flowering things.

Likewise, some evening, I would creep,
When midnight sounds, and everywhere
The sighing of lovers fills the air,
To the hushed alcove where you sleep,

And waken you by violent storm,
And beat you coldly till you swooned,
And carve upon your perfect form,
With care, a deep seductive wound &mdash; 

And (joy delirious and complete!) 
Through those bright novel lips, through this 
Gaudy and virgin orifice, 
Infuse you with my venom, sweet.
