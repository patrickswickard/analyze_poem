Sympathetic Horror

From livid skies that, without end, 
As stormy as your future roll, 
What thoughts into your empty soul 
(Answer me, libertine!) descend?

-- Insatiable yet for all 
That turns on darkness, doom, or dice, 
I'll not, like Ovid, mourn my fall, 
Chased from the Latin paradise.

Skies, torn like seacoasts by the storm!
In you I see my pride take form,
And the huge clouds that rush in streams

Are the black hearses of my dreams, 
And your red rays reflect the hell, 
In which my heart is pleased to dwell.
