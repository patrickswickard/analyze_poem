Le Vin du solitaire

the wildering glances of a harlot fair
seen gliding toward us like the silver wake
of undulant moonlight on the quivering lake
when Phoebe bathes her languorous beauty there;

the last gold coins a gambler's fingers hold;
the wanton kiss of love-worn Adeline,
the wheedling songs that leave the will supine
&mdash; like far-off cries of sorrow unconsoled &mdash;

all these, o bottle deep, were never worth 
the pungent balsams in thy fertile girth
stored for the pious poet's thirsty heart;

thou pourest hope and youth and strength anew,
&mdash; and pride, this treasure of the beggar-crew, 
that lifts us like triumphant gods, apart!
