Alchemy of Sorrow

One puts all nature into mourning,
One lights her like a flaring sun -- 
What whispers "Burial" to the one
Cries to the other, "Life and Morning."

The unknown Hermes who assists
The role of Midas to reverse,
And makes me by a subtle curse
The saddest of all alchemists -- 

By him, my paradise to hell,
And gold to slag, is changed too well.
The clouds are winding-sheets, and I,

Bidding some dear-loved corpse farewell, 
Along the shore-line of the sky, 
Erect my vast sarcophagi.
