The Man Who Tortures Himself

I shall cleave without scrape or shock, 
And, like a butcher, without hate, 
Like Moses, when he struck the rock. 
From your eyes I shall generate 
Waters of woe throughout the years 
To quench my fierce Sahara fires, 
Swollen with vast hope, my desires 
Shall float upon your bitter tears 
Like a proud vessel, sailing large; 
And in my heart, drunk at the sound, 
Your cherished sobbing shall resound 
Like drums beating the long lost charge.

Am I not a discordant note 
In the celestial symphony, 
Thanks to voracious Irony 
Who shakes and bites me at the throat? 
She's in my voice, the scold; her black 
Poison is all my blood, alas! 
I am the direful looking glass 
Which flashes her reflection back. 
I am the wound, the knives that strike, 
The blows that crush, the head that reels, 
I am wrenched limbs and grinding wheels, 
Victim and hangman, as you like!

Vampire of my own heart, meanwhile, 
A derelict, I am of those 
Doomed to eternal laughter's throes, 
Yet powerless to frame a smile!
