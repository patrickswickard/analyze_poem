Obsession

Great woods, you frighten me like cathedrals; 
You roar like the organ; and in our cursed hearts, 
Rooms of endless mourning where old death-rattles sound, 
Respond the echoes of your De profundis.

I hate you, Ocean! your bounding and your tumult, 
My mind finds them within itself; that bitter laugh 
Of the vanquished man, full of sobs and insults, 
I hear it in the immense laughter of the sea.

How I would like you, Night! without those stars 
Whose light speaks a language I know! 
For I seek emptiness, darkness, and nudity!

But the darkness is itself a canvas 
Upon which live, springing from my eyes by thousands, 
Beings with understanding looks, who have vanished.
