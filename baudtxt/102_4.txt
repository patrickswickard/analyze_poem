Up

Above the valleys, above the mountains, above the sea,
Above the mists that rise at morning from river and pond &mdash; 
Beyond the sun, beyond the fringe of the ether, beyond
The boundaries of the fields of stars and nebulae,

With what deep bliss, with what insatiable delight,
My soul, like a good swimmer reveling in the wave,
You plunge into immensity! With what a grave
Mute joy you saturate yourself in the clear height!

Fly! Oh, indeed, fly far from this unwholesome place! 
Go and be purged in radiance, wheeling higher and higher: 
Be drunken, be washed through with the transparent fire, 
Be lost in the serene bright solitudes of space!

From these low vapors hanging in the windless air,
From these miasmas fraught with ancient woe and ill,
Most blest, most fortunate is he who can at will
Take flight into a region luminous and fair &mdash; 

He whose unwearied thoughts on effortless light wings
Go up like larks at morning, and circle without fear
Above the wakening land &mdash; aloof and free &mdash; and hear
The voices of the flowers and of all voiceless things!
