The Man Who Tortures Himself

To J. G. F.

I shall strike you without anger
And without hate, like a butcher,
As Moses struck the rock!
And from your eyelids I shall make

The waters of suffering gush forth
To inundate my Sahara.
My desire swollen with hope
Will float upon your salty tears

Like a vessel which puts to sea, 
And in my heart that they'll make drunk 
Your beloved sobs will resound 
Like a drum beating the charge!

Am I not a discord 
In the heavenly symphony, 
Thanks to voracious Irony 
Who shakes me and who bites me?

She's in my voice, the termagant! 
All my blood is her black poison! 
I am the sinister mirror 
In which the vixen looks.

I am the wound and the dagger! 
I am the blow and the cheek! 
I am the members and the wheel, 
Victim and executioner!

I'm the vampire of my own heart
-- One of those utter derelicts 
Condemned to eternal laughter, 
But who can no longer smile!
