<i>One Night When, near a Fearful Jewess Lying</i>

One night when, near a fearful Jewess lying, 
As one corpse by another corpse, I sprawled &mdash; 
Beside the venal body I was buying, 
The beauty that was absent I recalled.

I pictured you in native majesty
With glances full of energy and grace,
Your hair, a perfumed casque, whose memory
Revives me for the amorous embrace,

For madly I'd have kissed your noble frame,
And from your cool feet to your great black tresses,
Unleashed the treasure of profound caresses,

If with a single tear that gently came
You could have quenched, O queen of all the cruel!
The blazing of your eyes, their icy fuel.
