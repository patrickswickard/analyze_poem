A Martyred Woman

Sketch by an Unknown Master

In the middle of scent-bottles, braided material
And voluptuous furniture,
Amongst marbles, pictures, perfumed dresses 
Trailing in expensive folds,

In a warm room, where like a hothouse
The air is dangerous, fatal,
Where dying flowers sigh out their last 
In their glass coffins,

A headless corpse discharges, like a river, 
Upon the slaked pillow,
Its red and living blood, which the linen laps up
With the greed of a meadow.

Like those ghastly visions engendered by shadows, 
And riveting our eyes
The head, with the weight of its dark mane 
And its precious jewels

Rests like a plant on the bedside table; 
And, empty of thoughts,
A look, loose and white as twilight 
Escapes its misplaced eyes.

On the bed the naked, shameless trunk spreads out 
In utter unconstraint
Its secret splendor and its fatal beauty, 
The gift of nature;

A pink stocking, embroidered with gold sequins, remains
On the leg like a memory;
The garter, like a flaming, hidden eye, 
Darts a diamonded glance.

The strange look of this solitude
And of a great languorous tableau,
To eyes provocative as her posture
Reveals a dark love,

A guilty joy and strange feasts,
Full of the kisses of hell
That please the swarms of evil angels
Swimming in the folds of curtains;

And yet, seeing that elegant emaciation
Of shoulder with the blatant contour
The hip a little angular and the taut waistline
Like a furious reptile,

She is still quite young! &mdash; Did her inflamed soul
And her senses gnawn by boredom
Yawn for that thirsty pack of
Wandering, lost passions?

Did that vengeful man whom, living, you could not gratify,
In spite of so much love
Heap upon your indolent, accommodating flesh
The size of his desire?

Answer, O violated corpse! and raising yourself with feverish arm
By your stiff braids,
Tell me, terrifying head, did he press upon your cold teeth
His final farewells?

 &mdash; Far from the bantering world, from the corrupted mob,
Far from inquisitive magistrates,
Sleep peacefully, sleep peacefully, strange creature,
In your mysterious tomb;

Your husband roves the world and your deathless figure
Watches by him when he sleeps;
Doubtless he will be faithful as you are,
And constant to death.
