The Balcony

Mistress of mistresses, mother of memories, 
O you my every pleasure, you my every duty! 
You shall recall our blandishments and ecstasies, 
The warm peace of our hearth, the evening's placid beauty. 
Mistress of mistresses, mother of memories!

Evenings illumined by the glow of coals afire 
Or on the balcony, veiled in a rosy mist. 
How soft your breast, how kind your heart to my desire! 
We said imperishable things the while we kissed, 
Evenings illumined by the glow of coals afire.

How glorious the sunset on warm summer nights! 
How deep space is! the human heart how competent! 
As I bent over you, queen of my soul's delight, 
I thought I breathed your blood with its suave acrid scent. 
How glorious the sunset on warm summer nights!

The night grew dense, forming a wall to compass us, 
Across the dark your eyes bound mine with golden bands, 
I drank your breath in deep, O sweet, O poisonous! 
Your slender feet slept softly in my gentle hands. 
The night grew dense, forming a wall to compass us.

The resurrection of glad moments is an art 
I know: I live anew, my head pressed to your knees, 
For where, if not in your loved flesh and tender heart,
Can I seek out the wonder of your languidness?
The resurrection of glad moments is an art.

These vows, these fragrant scents, these kisses without end,
Shall they be born again out of infinity?
As suns rejuvenated in the skies ascend,
Having been laved in the unfathomable sea?
-- O vows! O fragrant scents! -- O kisses without end!
