The Exotic Perfume

When, with both eyes shut, on a close autumn evening, 
I breathe the perfume of your heated breast,
I see happy shores unfold themselves 
Dazzling in the flames of a monotonous sun;

A lay island where Nature bestows 
Peculiar trees and savory fruit; 
Men with bodies slim and virile, 
Women with eyes of astonishing candor.

Led by your odor to climates of charm,
I see a harbor full of sails and masts
Still tired by the waves of the sea,

Whilst the perfume of green tamarind-trees 
Circles the air and fills my nostrils, 
Meets in my soul with the song of the seamen.
