The Blind

My soul, survey them, dreadful as they seem. 
Like marionettes, ridiculous they stare. 
Strange as somnambulists that, in their dream, 
Dart shadowy orbs around we know not where.

Their eyes, from which the heavenly spark has flown 
Remain uplifted, as in distant quest, 
Skyward: but never on the paving stone 
Do they pore dreamingly or come to rest.

They traverse thus the illimitable Dark,
Twin of eternal Silence. While the City
May sing around us, bellow, laugh, or bark, &mdash; 

By pleasure blinded even to horror, I, 
Too, drag my way, but, more a thing of pity, 
Ask what the Blind are seeking there on high.
