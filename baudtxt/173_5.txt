The Burial of an Accursed Poet

If haply one dark, dreary night 
Some charitable soul appear 
And 'neath old rubble stow from sight 
The body that you held so dear -- 

What time the chaste stars veil their eyes, 
Drowsy and fain for slumber, there 
Spiders shall weave their traceries. 
Vipers their spotted young shall bear. 

Above your doomed head you will hear 
Each night throughout the heavy year 
The lean wolves' melancholy cries, 

Famished hags' bowlings for a crust, 
Lewd pastimes of old men who lust, 
And scoundrels' dark conspiracies.
