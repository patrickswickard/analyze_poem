To a Passerby

Around me thundered the deafening noise of the street, 
In mourning apparel, portraying majestic distress, 
With queenly ringers, just lifting the hem of her dress, 
A stately woman passed by with hurrying feet. 

Agile and noble, with limbs of perfect poise. 
Ah, how I drank, thrilled through like a Being insane, 
In her look, a dark sky, from whence springs forth the hurricane, 
There lay but the sweetness that charms, and the joy that destroys. 

A flash &mdash; then the night... O loveliness fugitive! 
Whose glance has so suddenly caused me again to live, 
Shall I not see you again till this life is o'er! 

Elsewhere, far away... too late, perhaps never more, 
For I know not whither you fly, nor you, where I go, 
O soul that I would have loved, and <i>that</i> you know!
