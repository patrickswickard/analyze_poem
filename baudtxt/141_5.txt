The Spiritual Dawn

When the morning white and rosy breaks, 
With the gnawing Ideal, upon the debauchee, 
By the power of a strange decree, 
Within the sotted beast an Angel wakes. 

The mental Heaven's inaccessible blue, 
For wearied mortals that still dream and mourn, 
Expands and sinks; towards the chasm drawn. 
Thus, cherished goddess, Being pure and true &mdash; 

Upon the rests of foolish orgy-nights 
Thine image, more sublime, more pink, more clear, 
Before my staring eyes is ever there. 

The sun has darkened all the candle lights;
And thus thy spectre like the immortal sun, 
Is ever victorious &mdash; thou resplendent one!
