Destruction

The Demon is always moving about at my side; 
He floats about me like an impalpable air; 
I swallow him, I feel him burn my lungs 
And fill them with an eternal, sinful desire.

Sometimes, knowing my deep love for Art, he assumes 
The form of a most seductive woman, 
And, with pretexts specious and hypocritical, 
Accustoms my lips to infamous philtres.

He leads me thus, far from the sight of God, 
Panting and broken with fatigue, into the midst 
Of the plains of Ennui, endless and deserted,

And thrusts before my eyes full of bewilderment, 
Dirty filthy garments and open, gaping wounds, 
And all the bloody instruments of Destruction!
