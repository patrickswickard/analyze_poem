The Death of Artists

How often must I shake my bells, and kiss 
Your brow, sad Travesty? How many a dart, 
My quiver, shoot at Nature's mystic heart 
Before I hit the target that I miss?

We'll still consume our souls in subtle schemes, 
Demolishing tough harness, long before 
We see the giant Creature of our dreams 
Whom all the world is weeping to adore.

Some never knew their Idol, though they prayed:
And these doomed sculptors, with an insult branded,
Hammer your brows and bosom, heavy-handed,

In the one hope, O Capitol of shade! 
That Death like some new sun should rise and give 
Warmth to their wasted flowers, and make them live.
