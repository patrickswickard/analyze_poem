Conversation

You're like an autumn sky, rose, clear, and placid. 
But sorrow whelms me, like the tide's assault, 
And ebbing, leaves upon my lips the acid 
And muddy-bitter memory of its salt.

Your hand may stroke my breast, but not console. 
What it seeks there is but a hole, deep caverned 
By women's claws and fangs, and ransacked whole. 
Seek not my heart, on which the beasts have ravened.

My heart's a palace plundered by the rabble: 
They tope, they kill, in blood and guts they scrabble:
&mdash; A perfume swims around your naked breast!

O Beauty, flail of spirits, you know best! 
With your eyes' fire, lit up as for a spree, 
Char the poor rags those beasts have left of me!
