The Enemy

I think of my gone youth as of a stormy sky 
Infrequently transpierced by a benignant sun; 
Tempest and hail have done their work; and what have I? &mdash; 
How many fruits in my torn garden? &mdash; scarcely one.

And now that I approach the autumn of my mind, 
And must reclaim once more the inundated earth &mdash; 
Washed into stony trenches deep as graves I find 
I wield the rake and hoe, asking, "What is it worth?"

Who can assure me, these new flowers for which I toil 
Will find in the disturbed and reconstructed soil 
That mystic aliment on which alone they thrive?

Oh, anguish, anguish! Time eats up all things alive; 
And that unseen, dark Enemy, upon the spilled 
Bright blood we could not spare, battens, and is fulfilled.
