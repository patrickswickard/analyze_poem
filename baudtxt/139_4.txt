The Angelic One

Spirit of happiness, hast thou heard tell of woe? 
Hast thou heard tell of anguish, and remorse, and care &mdash; 
Of those long nights when in the black fist of Despair 
The heart is crumpled up like paper? Dost thou know, 
Spirit of happiness? Hast thou heard tell of woe?

Spirit of kindliness, hast thou heard tell of hate, 
The clenched hands in the darkness, the silent bitter tears, 
With Vengeance beating in the arteries of our ears 
Its dogged tom-tom, irresistible as fate? 
Spirit of kindliness, hast thou heard tell of hate?

Spirit of health, hast thou heard whisper of Disease, 
Whose pallid children, in the courtyard gray with soot 
Of the bleak hospital, go dragging a slow foot 
To find a patch of sunlight? Host thou heard of these? 
Spirit of health, hast thou heard whisper of Disease?

Spirit of beauty, hast thou heard of ugliness, 
Of the long secret torment of growing old &mdash; above 
All else, the pain of reading in the eyes we love 
A wordless horror, even while the lips say "yes?" 
Spirit of beauty, hast thou heard of ugliness?

Spirit of joy, spirit of beauty, spirit of light, 
David, grown old, would have thought nothing to implore 
Thy healing touch, thy warm young presence in the night; 
But, spirit, I only ask of thee thy prayers, no more &mdash; 
Spirit of joy, spirit of beauty, spirit of light!
