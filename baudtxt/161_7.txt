Spleen

When the low and heavy sky presses like a lid 
On the groaning heart a prey to slow cares, 
And when from a horizon holding the whole orb 
There is cast at us a dark sky more sad than night;

When earth is changed to a damp dungeon, 
Where Hope, like a bat, 
Flees beating the walls with its timorous wings, 
And knocking its head on the rotting ceilings;

When the rain spreads out vast trails
Like the bars of a huge prison,
And when, like sordid spiders, silent people stretch
Threads to the depths of our brains,

Suddenly the bells jump furiously 
And hurl to the sky a horrible shriek, 
Like some wandering landless spirits 
Starting an obstinate complaint.

 &mdash; And long hearses, with no drums, no music, 
File slowly through my soul: Hope, 
Conquered, cries, and despotic atrocious Agony 
Plants on my bent skull its flag of black.
