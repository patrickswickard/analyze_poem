Lethe

Come to my arms, cruel and sullen thing;
Indolent beast, come to my arms again,
For I would plunge my fingers in your mane
And be a long time unremembering -- 

And bury myself in you, and breathe your wild 
Perfume remorselessly for one more hour: 
And breathe again, as of a ruined flower, 
The fragrance of the love you have defiled.

I long to sleep; I think that from a stark 
Slumber like death I could awake the same 
As I was once, and lavish without shame 
Caresses upon your body, glowing and dark.

To drown my sorrow there is no abyss, 
However deep, that can compare with your bed. 
Forgetfulness has made its country your red 
Mouth, and the flowing of Lethe is in your kiss.

My doom, henceforward, is my sole desire:
As martyrs, being demented in their zeal,
Shake with delightful spasms upon the wheel,
Implore the whip, or puff upon the fire,

So I implore you, fervently resigned! 
Come; I would drink nepenthe and long rest 
At the sweet points of this entrancing breast 
Wherein no heart has ever been confined.
