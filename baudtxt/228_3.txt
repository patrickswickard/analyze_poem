Parisian Dream

To Constantin Guys

I

Of the dread landscape that I saw, 
Where human eyes were never set, 
I still am ravished by the awe 
That, vague and distant, haunts me yet.

Sleep is of miracles so fain 
That I (O singular caprice!) 
As being formless, could obtain 
That vegetable life should cease.

A painter, in my genius free, 
I there exulted in the fettle 
Derived from a monotony 
Composed of marble, lymph, and metal.

Babels of stairways and arcades, 
Endless and topless to behold, 
With ponds, and jets, and steep cascades 
Filling receptacles of gold:

Ponderous cataracts there swung 
Like crystal curtains, foaming shawls &mdash; 
Dazzling and glittering they hung 
Suspended from the metal walls.

Not trees, but colonnades, enclosed 
Motionless lakes, besides whose shelves 
Gigantic naiades reposed, 
Like women, gazing at themselves.

Blue sheets of water interlay 
Unnumbered quays of green and rose, 
That stretched a million leagues away 
To where the bounds of space impose.

'Twas formed of unknown stones that blazed 
And magic waves that intersect, 
Where icebergs floated, seeming dazed 
With all they mirror and reflect.

Impassive, cold, and taciturn, 
Great Ganges, through the sky's vast prism, 
Each poured the treasures of its urn
Into a diamond abysm.

Architect of my fairy scene, 
I willed, by wondrous stratagems, 
An ocean, tamed, to pass between 
A tunnel that was made of gems.

There all things, even the colour black, 
Seemed irridescently to play, 
And liquid crystalised its lack 
Of outline in a frozen ray.

No star, no sun could be discerned, 
Even low down, in that vast sky: 
The fire was personal that burned 
To show these marvels to the eye.

Above these moving wonders sheer 
There soared (that such a thing should be!
All for the eye, none for the ear!) 
A silence of eternity.

II

My opening eyes, as red as coal, 
The horror of my lodging met. 
I felt re-entering my soul 
The knife of cares and vain regret.

The clock with brutal accent played 
Funereal chimes. The time was noon 
And heaven covered, with its shade, 
The world, this fatuous balloon!
