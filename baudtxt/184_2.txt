Allegory

She's a beautiful woman with opulent shoulders 
Who lets her long hair trail in her goblet of wine. 
The claws of love, the poisons of brothels, 
All slips and all is blunted on her granite skin. 
She laughs at Death and snaps her fingers at Debauch. 
The hands of those monsters, ever cutting and scraping, 
Have respected nonetheless the pristine majesty 
Of her firm, straight body at its destructive games. 
She walks like a goddess, rests like a sultana; 
She has a Mohammedan's faith in pleasure 
And to her open arms which are filled by her breasts, 
She lures all mortals with her eyes. 
She believes, she knows, this virgin, sterile 
And yet essential to the march of the world, 
That a beautiful body is a sublime gift 
That wrings a pardon for any foul crime. 
She is unaware of Hell and Purgatory 
And when the time comes for her to enter 
The black Night, she will look into the face of Death 
As a new-born child, &mdash; without hatred or remorse.
