The Living Torch

They stand before me now, those eyes that shine, 
No doubt inspired by an Angel wise; 
They stand, those God-like brothers that are mine, 
And pour their diamond fires in mine eyes. 

From all transgressions, from all snares, they save, 
Towards the Path of Joy they guide my ways;
They are my servants, and I am their slave;
And all my soul, this living torch obeys. 

Ye charming Eyes &mdash; ye have those mystic beams, 
Of candles, burning in full day; the sun 
Awakes, yet kills not their fantastic gleams: 

Ye sing the Awak'ning, they the dark oblivion;
The Awak'ning of my spirit ye proclaim, 
O stars &mdash; no sun can ever kill your flame!
