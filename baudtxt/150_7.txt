You are the loveliness, the clearness, the red of autumn skies!
But sadness climbs like a sea in me, 
Leaving, in reflux, upon my bitter lip
The sharp memory of its biting slime.

 -- In vain your hand slips on my fainting chest; 
What it seeks, my darling, is but a place pillaged 
By the fang and the fierce tooth of woman. 
Do not search for my heart anymore; the wild beasts have eaten it.

My heart is a palace soiled by the mob;
There they swill, and they brawl, and they kill!
 -- A fragrance swims around your naked breasts.

O Beauty, cruel scourge of souls, you long for it!
With your eyes that flame, brilliant as festivals,
Bum these tatters that the beasts have spared me!
