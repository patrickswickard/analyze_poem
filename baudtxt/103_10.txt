Correspondences

Nature is a temple where living pillars 
Let sometimes emerge confused words; 
Man crosses it through forests of symbols 
Which watch him with intimate eyes.

Like those deep echoes that meet from afar 
In a dark and profound harmony, 
As vast as night and clarity, 
So perfumes, colors, tones answer each other.

There are perfumes fresh as children's flesh,
Soft as oboes, green as meadows,
And others, corrupted, rich, triumphant,

Possessing the diffusion of infinite things, 
Like amber, musk, incense and aromatic resin, 
Chanting the ecstasies of spirit and senses.
