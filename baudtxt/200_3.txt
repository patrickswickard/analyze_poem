The Albatross

Sometimes for sport the men of loafing crews 
Snare the great albatrosses of the deep, 
The indolent companions of their cruise 
As through the bitter vastitudes they sweep.

Scarce have they fished aboard these airy kings 
When helpless on such unaccustomed floors, 
They piteously droop their huge white wings 
And trail them at their sides like drifting oars.

How comical, how ugly, and how meek 
Appears this soarer of celestial snows! 
One, with his pipe, teases the golden beak, 
One, limping, mocks the cripple as he goes.

The Poet, like this monarch of the clouds, 
Despising archers, rides the storm elate. 
But, stranded on the earth to jeering crowds, 
The great wings of the giant baulk his gait.
