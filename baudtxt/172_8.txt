The Joyous Corse

In a soil full of snails and free from stones 
I fain would dig myself a pit full deep, 
Where I might lay at ease my aged bones 
And, like a wave-borne shark, forgetful sleep. 

For testaments I hate, and tombs I hate; 
Rather than crave a tear from human eyes 
I would invite the crows their hunger sate 
Upon my corpse's foul extremities. 

O worms! O black, deaf, sightless company! 
There comes to you a dead man glad and free. 
O philosophic sons of rottenness, 
Across my ruin crawl without remorse, 
And tell if any pain may yet oppress 
This old and soulless death-surrounded corse.
