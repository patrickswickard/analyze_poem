The Love of Lies

When I see you pass by, my indolent darling, 
To the sound of music that the ceiling deadens, 
Pausing in your slow and harmonious movements, 
Turning here and there the boredom of your gaze;

When I study, in the gaslight which colors it,
Your pale forehead, embellished with a morbid charm,
Where the torches of evening kindle a dawn,
And your eyes alluring as a portrait's,

I say within: "How fair she is! How strangely fresh!" 
Huge, massive memory, royal, heavy tower, 
Crowns her; her heart bruised like a peach 
Is ripe like her body for a skillful lover.

Are you the autumn fruit with sovereign taste? 
A funereal urn awaiting a few tears? 
Perfume that makes one dream of distant oases? 
A caressive pillow, a basket of flowers?

I know that there are eyes, most melancholy ones,
In which no precious secrets lie hidden;
Lovely cases without jewels, lockets without relics,
Emptier and deeper than you are, O Heavens!

But is it not enough that you are a semblance 
To gladden a heart that flees from the truth? 
What matter your obtuseness or your indifference? 
Mask or ornament, hail! I adore your beauty.
