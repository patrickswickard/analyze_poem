Le Flambeau vivant

they march before me, filled with light divine 
&mdash; those eyes turned magnets by some angel wise;
they lead, my Heavenly Twins, good brothers mine,
whose jewelled fires hold my gazing eyes.

they guard from every sin and error grave,
they show my feet the path to Beauty's porch;
they are my servitors and I their slave,
wholly obedient to their heavenly torch.

enchanted eyes, ye have the mystic ray
of tapers lit at noon: the fire of day
reddens, but quenches not their eery glow: &mdash;

'tis Death they sing, while ye extol the Morn;
ye point the way and chant a soul reborn
&mdash; stars that no sun can pale nor overthrow!
