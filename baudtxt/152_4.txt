Francescae Meae Laudes

I shall sing new chords, O hind, 
As you gambol unconfined 
Through my solitary mind.

Rest, adorned with wreaths of flowers,
Comely woman whose vast powers
Wash away these sins of ours

As from Lethe's stream I shall
Drink your kisses, one and all,
Magnet-like and magical.

When our vices stormily 
Swept down every path with glee, 
You approved, O Deity!

Like the bright star of salvation
Amid shipwreck's desolation &mdash; 
Take my heart in rapt oblation.

Source of every good and store
Of eternal youth, restore
Song to my mute lips once more.

What was foul you calcinated
What was rough you Ievigated,
What was weak you stimulated.

In my hunger, you the inn,
In my dark, the lamp; and in
Your pale hands, an end to sin.

Add your strength to mine, new-sent,
Sweet bath ever redolent
Of the suaver perfumes blent.

From my loins, gleam radiantly
O cuirass of chastity
Steeped in balm seraphically.

Cup with precious gems ashine,
Savory bread, celestial wine,
Blessed food, Francesca mine!
