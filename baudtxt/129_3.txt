Lethe

Rest on my heart, deaf, cruel soul, adored 
Tigress, and monster with the lazy air. 
I long, in the black jungles of your hair, 
To force each finger thrilling like a sword:

Within wide skirts, filled with your scent, to hide 
My bruised and battered forehead hour by hour, 
And breathe, like dampness from a withered flower, 
The pleasant mildew of a love that died.

Rather than live, I wish to sleep, alas! 
Lulled in a slumber soft and dark as death, 
In ruthless kisses lavishing my breath 
Upon your body smooth as burnished brass.

To swallow up my sorrows in eclipse, 
Nothing can match your couch's deep abysses; 
The stream of Lethe issues from your kisses 
And powerful oblivion from your lips.

Like a predestined victim I submit: 
My doom, to me, henceforth, is my delight, 
A willing martyr in my own despite 
Whose fervour fans the faggots it has lit.

To drown my rancour and to heal its smart, 
Nepenthe and sweet hemlock, peace and rest, 
I'll drink from the twin summits of a breast 
That never lodged the semblance of a heart.
