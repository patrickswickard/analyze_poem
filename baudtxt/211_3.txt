Sisina

Picture Diana, gallantly arrayed, 
Ranging the woods, elated with the chase, 
With flying hair and naked breasts displayed, 
Defying fleetest horsemen with her pace.

Know you Theroigne whom blood and fire exalt, 
Hounding a shoeless rabble to the fray, 
Up royal stairways heading the assault, 
And mounting, sword in hand, to show the way?

Such is Sisina. Terrible her arms.
But charity restrains her killing charms.
Though rolling drums and scent of powder madden

Her courage, &mdash; laying by its pikes and spears, 
For those who merit, her scorched heart will sadden, 
And open, in its depth, a well of tears.
