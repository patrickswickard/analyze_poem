Obsession

Great woods! like mighty fanes you frighten me, 
You howl like the organ; in our cursed souls, 
Grey grief-chambers where old death-rattles be, 
Your many-echoing "De profundis" rolls. 

I hate thee, Ocean! for my spirit is torn 
With tumults like thine own; a laugh has birth, 
Like a beaten man's, full of all tears and scorn 
And bitterness, within the sea's vast mirth. 

Ah! how I love thee, Night, when not a star 
Speaks with known tongue of light through the dark air; 
For lo! I seek the void, the black, the bare; 

Yet even darkest depths but curtains are 
Where live, shot from my eye, innumerable 
Lost forms and faces that I know too well.
