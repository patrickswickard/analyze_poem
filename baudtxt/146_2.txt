The Cat

I

In my brain there walks about,
As though he were in his own home,
A lovely cat, strong, sweet, charming.
When he mews, one scarcely hears him,

His tone is so discreet and soft; 
But purring or growling, his voice 
Is always deep and rich; 
That is his charm and secret.

That voice forms into drops, trickles 
Into the depths of my being, 
Fills me like harmonious verse 
And gladdens me like a philtre.

It lulls to sleep the sharpest pains,
Contains all ecstasies;
To say the longest sentences,
It has no need of words,

No, there's no bow that plays upon
My heart, that perfect instrument,
And makes its most vibrant chord
Sing more gloriously

Than your voice, mysterious cat, 
Seraphic cat, singular cat, 
In whom, as in angels, all is 
As subtle as harmonious!

From his brown and yellow fur 
Comes such sweet fragrance that one night 
I was perfumed with it because 
I caressed him once, once only.

A familiar figure in the place, 
He presides, judges, inspires 
Everything within his province; 
Perhaps he is a fay, a god?

When my gaze, drawn as by a magnet,
Turns in a docile way
Toward that cat whom I love,
And when I look within myself,

I see with amazement 
The fire of his pale pupils, 
Clear signal-lights, living opals, 
That contemplate me fixedly.
