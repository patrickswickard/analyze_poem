The Carcase

The object that we saw, let us recall, 
This summer morn when warmth and beauty mingle -- 
At the path's turn, a carcase lay asprawl
Upon a bed of shingle.

Legs raised, like some old whore far-gone in passion, 
The burning, deadly, poison-sweating mass 
Opened its paunch in careless, cynic fashion, 
Ballooned with evil gas.

On this putrescence the sun blazed in gold, 
Cooking it to a turn with eager care -- 
So to repay to Nature, hundredfold, 
What she had mingled there.

The sky, as on the opening of a flower, 
On this superb obscenity smiled bright. 
The stench drove at us, with such fearsome power 
You thought you'd swoon outright.

Flies trumpeted upon the rotten belly 
Whence larvae poured in legions far and wide, 
And flowed, like molten and liquescent jelly, 
Down living rags of hide.

The mass ran down, or, like a wave elated 
Rolled itself on, and crackled as if frying: 
You'd think that corpse, by vague breath animated, 
Drew life from multiplying.

Through that strange world a rustling rumour ran 
Like rushing water or a gust of air, 
Or grain that winnowers, with rhythmic fan, 
Sweep simmering here and there.

It seemed a dream after the forms grew fainter, 
Or like a sketch that slowly seems to dawn 
On a forgotten canvas, which the painter 
From memory has drawn.

Behind the rocks a restless cur that slunk 
Eyed us with fretful greed to recommence 
His feast, amidst the bonework, on the chunk 
That he had torn from thence.

Yet you'll resemble this infection too 
One day, and stink and sprawl in such a fashion, 
Star of my eyes, sun of my nature, you, 
My angel and my passion!

Yes, you must come to this, O queen of graces, 
At length, when the last sacraments are over, 
And you go down to moulder in dark places 
Beneath the grass and clover.

Then tell the vermin as it takes its pleasance 
And feasts with kisses on that face of yours, 
I've kept intact in form and godlike essence 
Our decomposed amours!
