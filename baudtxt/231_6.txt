Le Voyage

... the traveller finds the earth a bitter school!
a dwindled waste, which boredom amplifies!
where trite oases from each muddy pool
one thing reflect: his horror-haunted eyes!

must we depart or stay? if needs be, go;
stay if ye can. One runs, another hides
to cheat that vigilant, remorseless foe,
old Time! and runners tireless, besides,

like the Apostles and the Wandering Jew,
have found no courser swift enough to baulk
that monster with his net, whom others knew
how to destroy before they learned to walk.

but when at last It stands upon our throats,
then we can shout exulting: forward now!
as once to Asian shores we launched our boats, 
with wind-blown hair and seaward-gazing brow,

we shall push off upon Night's shadowy Sea,
blithely as one embarking when a boy;
o soft funereal voices calling thee,
hark to their chant: "come, ye who would enjoy

the fragrant sorcery of the lotus-flower!
come! with the long-craved fruit ye shall commune,
drunk with the sweetness and the drowsy power
of this enchanted endless afternoon!"

we know the phantom by its old behest;
yonder our mates hold beckoning arms toward ours,
"come, cool thy heart on my refreshing breast!"
cries she whose knees we kissed in happier hours.

...


cast off, old Captain Death! the time has come!
we hate this weary shore and would depart!
though sea and sky are drowned in murky gloom,
thy beckoning flames blaze high in every heart!

pour out, to comfort us, thy poison-brew!
so burnt our souls with fires implacable,
into the Pit unplumbed, to find the New,
we'd plunge, nor care if it were Heaven nor Hell!
