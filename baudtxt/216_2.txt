The Alchemy of Sorrow

One man lights you with his ardor,
Another puts you in mourning, Nature!
That which says to one: sepulcher!
Says to another: life! glory!

You have always frightened me, 
Hermes the unknown, you who help me. 
You make me the peer of Midas, 
The saddest of all alchemists;

Through you I change gold to iron 
And make of paradise a hell; 
In the winding sheet of the clouds

I discover a beloved corpse, 
And on the celestial shores 
I build massive sarcophagi.
