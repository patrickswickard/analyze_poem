Brumes et pluies

o muddy Aprils, autumns, winters too!
o drowsy seasons! love and praise to you
I bring, for over heart and brain ye throw
your misty shrouds and tombs to hide me so.

vast plain, where Boreas mocks her brawling crew,
hoarse weather-vanes which creak the whole night through, 
ye rouse me more than May, for now I go
soaring on wider condor wings of woe.

wan months of mist which in the north prevail,
no boon so dear to souls whereon the snows
forever fall, and shades of death enclose,

as your unending twilight cold and pale,
&mdash; unless, some moonless eve should find us, twain,
creeping in beds of chance to lull our pain.
