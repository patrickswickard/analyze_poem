The Joyful Corpse

In a rich, heavy soil, infested with snails, 
I wish to dig my own grave, wide and deep, 
Where I can at leisure stretch out my old bones 
And sleep in oblivion like a shark in the wave.

I have a hatred for testaments and for tombs; 
Rather than implore a tear of the world, 
I'd sooner, while alive, invite the crows 
To drain the blood from my filthy carcass.

O worms! black companions with neither eyes nor ears,
See a dead man, joyous and free, approaching you;
Wanton philosophers, children of putrescence,

Go through my ruin then, without remorse, 
And tell me if there still remains any torture 
For this old soulless body, dead among the dead!
