Spleen

The rainy moon of all the world is weary, 
And from its urn a gloomy cold pours down, 
Upon the pallid inmates of the mortuary, 
And on the neighbouring- outskirts of the town. 

My wasted cat, in searching for a litter, 
Bestirs its mangy paws from post to post;
(A poet's soul that wanders in the gutter, 
With the jaded voice of a shiv'ring ghost). 

The smoking pine-log, while the drone laments, 
Accompanies the wheezy pendulum, 
The while amidst a haze of dirty scents, 

&mdash; Those fatal remnants of a sick man's room &mdash;
The gallant knave of hearts and queen of spades 
Relate their ancient amorous escapades.
