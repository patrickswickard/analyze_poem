The Jewels

The lovely one was naked and, knowing well my prayer, 
She wore her loud bright armory of jewels. They 
Evoked in her the savage and victorious air 
Of Moorish concubines upon a holiday.

When it gives forth, being shaken, its gay mocking noise, 
This world of metal and of stone, aflare in the night, 
Excites me monstrously, for chiefest of my joys 
Is the luxurious commingling of sound and light.

Relaxed among the pillows, she looked down at me 
And let herself be gazed upon at leisure -- as if 
Lulled by my wordless adoration, like the sea 
Washing perpetually about the foot of a cliff.

Slowly, regarding me like a trained leopardess, 
She slouched into successive poses. A certain ease, 
A certain candor coupled with lasciviousness, 
Lent a new charm to the old metamorphoses.

The whole lithe harmony of loins, hips, buttocks, thighs,
Tawny and sleek, and undulant as the neck of a swan,
Began to move hypnotically before my eyes:
And her large breasts, those fruits I have grown lean upon,

I saw float toward me, tempting as the angels of hell, 
To win my soul in thralldom to their dark caprice 
Once more, and lure it down from the high citadel 
Where, calm and solitary, it thought to have found peace.

She stretched and reared, and made herself all belly. In truth,
It was as if some playful artist had joined the stout
Hips of Antiope to the torso of a youth!...
The room grew dark, the lamp having flickered and gone out,

And now the whispering fire that had begun to die, 
Falling in lucent embers, was all the light therein -- 
And when it heaved at moments a flamboyant sigh 
It inundated as with blood her amber skin.
