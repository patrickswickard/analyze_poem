Morning Twilight

Reveille was blown in the courtyards of barracks,
And the morning wind fanned the lanterns.

It was the hour when those swarms of unwholesome dreams 
Twist on their pillows the brown adolescents; 
When, like a bloody eye, throbbing and roving, 
The lamp marks the day with a red freckle, 
When the soul, burdened by the irritable, heavy body, 
Copies the struggles of the lamp and the day. 
Like a weeping face, wiped by breezes, 
The air is filled with quivering of escaping things 
And man is tired of writing and woman of loving.

Here and there houses began to smoke. 
The ladies of delight, with livid eyelids, 
Mouths open, slept their futile sleep; 
Pauper women, dragging their thin, cold breasts, 
Blew on their brands and blew on their fingers. 
It was the hour when in cold and frugality 
The pangs of the laboring woman are quickened; 
Like a sob sliced by spumy blood 
The misty air was slashed by the song of the cock; 
A sea of fog bathed the buildings, 
And the agonized in the depths of asylums 
Uttered their last death-rattles in irregular hiccups. 
The debauchees returned, broken by their business.

Dawn, chattering with cold, in its pink and green robe, 
Advanced slowly over the deserted Seine, 
And gray Paris, rubbing its eyes, 
Reached for its tools, like an aged workman.
