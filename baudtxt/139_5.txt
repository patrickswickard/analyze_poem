Reversibility

Angel, teeming with gaiety, do you know grief,
Anguish, remorse and shame, their ravages and blights,
And the vague terrors of those panic-stricken nights
Which squeeze the heartstrings dry as a sere crumpled leaf?
Angel, teeming with gaiety, do you know grief?

Angel, teeming with kindliness, do you know hate, 
Fists tight-clenched in the shadows, scalding tears of gall, 
When Vengeance roars with his infernal battle-call, 
Making himself the captain of our acts and fate? 
Angel, teeming with kindliness, do you know hate?

Angel, teeming with healthfulness, do you know Fever 
Who like an exile lopes with dragging step towards 
The wan stark walls of hospitals and public wards, 
Mumbling, seeking rare sunlight for a brace or lever? 
Angel, teeming with healthfulness, do you know Fever?

Angel, teeming with loveliness, do you know wrinkles, 
The fear of growing old, and, like a poisoned potion, 
The dread of seeing love turn into fond devotion 
In eyes adored, once blue and pure as periwinkles? 
Angel, teeming with loveliness, do you know wrinkles?

Angel, teeming with happy, blithe, luminous airs, 
David upon his deathbed would have craved for power 
From the suave emanations of your body's flower, 
But I, angel, beseech of you only your prayers, 
Angel, teeming with happy, blithe, luminous airs!
