Sed Non Satiata

Dusky as tropic nights, O bizarre deity,
Redolent of havana, musk and cordovan,
What obeah man or Faust of the Caribbean,
Wrought you, child-witch of night, with flanks of ebony?
Better than opium or Constanta Wine or <i>Nuits,</i>
Your nectar mouth where Love swoons in a slow pavane,
When my desires set forth, a serried caravan,
Your eyes are the twin wells where I can slake ennui.

From out these wide black eyes which are your spirit's vent, 
Heap fires less fierce upon me. O impenitent, 
I am no tireless Styx to gird you nine times nine, 
I am no lustful Fury to exhaust your lust, 
To break your vigor or to make you bite the dust 
Or in your bed's hell turn into a Proserpine.
