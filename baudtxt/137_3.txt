The Living Torch

Those lit eyes go before me, in full view, 
(Some cunning angel magnetised their light) -- 
Heavenly twins, yet my own brothers too, 
Shaking their diamond blaze into my sight.

My steps from every trap or sin to save, 
In the strait road of Beauty they conduct me. 
They are my servants, and I am their slave, 
Obedient in whatever they instruct me.

Delightful eyes, you burn with mystic rays 
Like candles in broad day; red suns may blaze, 
But cannot quench their still, fantastic light.

Those candles burn for death, but you for waking: 
You sing the dawn that in my soul is breaking, 
Stars which no sun could ever put to flight!
