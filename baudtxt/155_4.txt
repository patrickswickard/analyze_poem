Cats

No one but indefatigable lovers and old 
Chilly philosophers can understand the true 
Charm of these animals serene and potent, who 
Likewise are sedentary and suffer from the cold.

They are the friends of learning and of sexual bliss; 
Silence they love, and darkness, where temptation breeds. 
Erebus would have made them his funereal steeds, 
Save that their proud free nature would not stoop to this.

Like those great sphinxes lounging through eternity 
In noble attitudes upon the desert sand, 
They gaze incuriously at nothing, calm and wise.

Their fecund loins give forth electric flashes, and 
Thousands of golden particles drift ceaselessly, 
Like galaxies of stars, in their mysterious eyes.
