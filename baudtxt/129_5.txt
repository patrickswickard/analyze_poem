Lethe

Tigress adored, indolent fiend, lie there, 
There on my heart now, merciless and strong, 
I wish to run my trembling fingers long 
Through the black tangles of your heavy hair, 
To plunge my aching head amorous of 
Your skirts as into secret, perfumed bowers, 
To breathe your scent as from pale withered flowers 
The after-flavor of my defunct love.

I wish to sleep rather than live, alas!
In slumber deep and sweet as death, O lover,
As my fierce and remorseless kisses cover
Your lovely body, bright as burnished brass,
To bury my stilled sobs in the abysses
Of your anodyne bed, to feast upon
Your lips that shed potent oblivion,
To drink the Lethe flowing in your kisses.

I shall delight in following my fate, 
Obeying it gladly as a man contemned, 
O docile martyr, innocent condemned 
To tortures that his fervors aggravate. 
With suckling lips to quell my spleen and rancor, 
Nepenthe I shall drain, and hemlock's sweets, 
Out of the magic tips of pointed teats 
That never served a human heart for anchor.
