Moesta Et Errabunda

Agatha, tell me, thy heart -- does it sometimes fly away, 
Far from the vast dark ocean of the mournful town, 
Toward one still vaster, mirroring the blue, blue day, 
Mindless and deep: a flood wherein all sorrows drown? 
Agatha, tell me, thy heart -- does it sometimes fly away?

The sea, the enormous sea has rest for our desires: 
By what demoniac irony can that fierce thing, 
That raucous howler to the winds' untuneful choirs, 
Assuage our deepest woe with its wild clarnouring? 
The sea, the enormous sea has rest for our desires.

Carry me off, loud trains! Abstract me, silent ships,
Far, far! Here even the earth is miry with our tears!
Is it not true that sometimes Agatha's sweet lips
Murmur: "Far from regrets, from griefs, from cruel fears,
Carry me off, loud trains! Abstract me, silent ships!"

How far, how far away, that paradise above,
Wbere all our ills supposedly are put to rest,
Where everything we love is worthy of our love,
And the unburdened heart lies weightless in the breast
How far, how far away, that paradise above!

But the green, earthly paradise of childhood, even,
The songs, the furtive kisses, the dances, the bouquets,
The picnics on the hillside -- that unpretentious heaven
Of summer twilights where a distant music plays:
But the green, earthly paradise of childhood, even,

Where all our cares are mended in small secret joys -- 
Is it already farther than Shanghai or Ceylon? 
Or has the heart some kingdom no suffering destroys, 
Where those young voices laugh, where those old tunes play on 
Where all our cares are mended in small secret joys?
