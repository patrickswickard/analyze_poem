De Profundis Clamavi

Have pity, my one love and sole delight! 
Down to a dark abyss my heart has sounded, 
A mournful world, by grey horizons bounded, 
Where blasphemy and horror swim by night.

For half the year a heatless sun gives light, 
The other half the night obscures the earth. 
The arctic regions never knew such dearth. 
No woods, nor streams, nor creatures meet the sight.

No horror in the world could match in dread 
The cruelty of that dire sun of frost, 
And that huge night like primal chaos spread.

I envy creatures of the vilest kind 
That they in stupid slumber can be lost &mdash; 
So slowly does the skein of time unwind!
