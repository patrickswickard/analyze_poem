All of Her

The Devil into my high room
This morning came to pay a call,
And trying to find me in fault
Said: "I should like to know,

Among all the beautiful things
Which make her an enchantress,
Among the objects black or rose
That compose her charming body,

Which is the sweetest." &mdash; O my soul! 
You answered the loathsome Creature: 
"Since in Her all is dittany, 
No single thing can be preferred.

When all delights me, I don't know 
If some one thing entrances me. 
She dazzles like the Dawn 
And consoles like the Night;

And the harmony that governs 
Her whole body is too lovely 
For impotent analysis 
To note its numerous accords.

O mystic metamorphosis 
Of all my senses joined in one! 
Her breath makes music, 
And her voice makes perfume!"
