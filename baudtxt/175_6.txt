Music

Oft Music possesses me like the seas! 
To my planet pale, 
'Neath a ceiling of mist, in the lofty breeze, 
I set my sail. 

With inflated lungs and expanded chest, 
Like to a sail, 
On the backs of the heaped-up billows I rest &mdash;
Which the shadows veil &mdash;

I feel all the anguish within me arise 
Of a ship in distress;
The tempest, the rain, 'neath the lowering skies, 

My body caress: 
At times, the calm pool or the mirror clear 
Of my despair!
