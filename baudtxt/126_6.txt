A Carrion

Rememberest thou, my sweet, that summer's day, 
How in the sun outspread 
At a path's bend a filthy carcase lay 
Upon a pebbly bed? 

Like a lewd woman, with its legs in air, 
Burned, oozed the poisonous mass; 
Its gaping belly, calm and debonair, 
Was full of noisome gas. 

And steadily upon this rottenness. 
As though to cook it brown 
And render Nature hundredfold excess. 
The sun shone down. 

The blue sky thought the carrion marvellous, 
A flower most fair to see; 
And as we gazed it almost poisoned us &mdash; 
It stank so horribly. 

The flies buzzed on this putrid belly, whence 
Black hosts of maggots came, 
Which streamed in thick and shining rivers thence 
Along that ragged frame. 

Pulsating like a wave, spirting about 
Bright jets, it seemed to live; 
As though it were by some vague wind blown out, 
Some breath procreative. 

And all this life was strangely musical 
Like wind or bubbling spring, 
Or corn which moves with rhythmic rise and fall 
In time of winnowing. 

The lines became indefinite and faint 
As a thin dream that dies, 
A half-forgotten scene the hand can paint 
Only from memories...

Behind the rocks there lurked a hungry hound 
With melancholy eye, 
Longing to nose the morsel he had found 
And gnaw it greedily. 

Yet thou shalt be as vile a carrion 
As this infection dire, 
O bright star of my eyes, my nature's sun, 
My angel, my desire! 

Yea, such, O queen of the graces, shalt thou be 
After the last soft breath. 
Beneath the grass and the lush greenery 
A-mouldering in death! 

When thy sweet flesh the worms devour with kisses, 
Tell them, O beauty mine. 
Of rotting loves I keep the bodily blisses 
And essence all-divine!
