The Pipe

I am an author's pipe; 
From examining my Abyssinian 
Or Kaffir countenance, one sees 
That my master is a great smoker.

When he is laden with sorrow,
I smoke like a cottage
When the cooking is being prepared
Against the laborer's return

I entwine and I cradle his soul
In the drifting, blue film
That climbs from my fiery mouth,

And I turn a powerful balm 
Which charms his heart and heals 
His spirit of fatigues.
