The Vampire

Thou who abruptly as a knife
Didst come into my heart; thou who,
A demon horde into my life,
Didst enter, wildly dancing, through

The doorways of my sense unlatched
To make my spirit thy domain -- 
Harlot to whom I am attached
As convicts to the ball and chain,

As gamblers to the wheel's bright spell, 
As drunkards to their raging thirst, 
As corpses to their worms -- accurst 
Be thou! Oh, be thou damned to hell!

I have entreated the swift sword 
To strike, that I at once be freed; 
The poisoned phial I have implored 
To plot with me a ruthless deed.

Alas! the phial and the blade 
Do cry aloud and laugh at me: 
"Thou art not worthy of our aid; 
Thou art not worthy to be free.

"Though one of us should be the tool
To save thee from thy wretched fate,
Thy kisses would resuscitate
The body of thy vampire, fool!"
