The Joyous Dead

In a fat, greasy soil, that's full of snails, 
I'll dig a grave deep down, where I may sleep 
Spreading my bones at ease, to drowse in deep 
Oblivion, as a shark within the wave.

I hate all tombs, and testaments, and wills: 
I want no human tears; I'd like it more, 
That ravens could attack me with their bills, 
To broach my carcase of its living gore.

O worms! black friends, who cannot hear or see,
A free and joyous corpse behold in me!
You philosophic souls, corruption-bred,

Plough through my ruins! eat your merry way! 
And if there are yet further torments, say, 
For this old soulless corpse among the dead.
