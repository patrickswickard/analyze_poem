The Death of Lovers

We shall have beds round which light scents are wafted,
Divans which are as deep and wide as tombs; 
Strange flowers that under brighter skies were grafted 
Will scent our shelves with rare exotic blooms.

When, burning to the last their mortal ardour, 
Our torch-like hearts their bannered flames unroll, 
Their double light will kindle all the harder 
Within the deep, twinned mirror of our soul.

One evening made of mystic rose and blue, 
I will exchange a lightning-flash with you, 
Like a long sob that bids a last adieu.

Later, the Angel, opening the door 
Faithful and happy, will at last renew 
Dulled mirrors, and the flames that leap no more.
