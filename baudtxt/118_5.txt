The Giantess

In times when Nature, lusty to excess, 
Bred monstrous children, would that I had been 
Living beside a youthful giantess, 
Like a voluptuous cat beside a queen; 
To see her soul and body gain full size 
Blossoming freely in her fearsome games, 
And by the damp mists swimming in her eyes 
To watch her heart nursing what somber flames!

To roam her mighty form at my sweet ease,
To crawl along the slopes of her vast knees,
And, summers, when the sun's unhealthy heats
Made her sprawl, tired, across the countryside
To sleep at leisure, shaded by her teats,
Like a calm hamlet by the mountainside.
