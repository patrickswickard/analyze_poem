Ill-Starred

A man would needs be brave and strong
As Sisyphus, for such a task! 
It is not greater zeal I ask -- 
But life is brief, and art is long.

To a forsaken mound of clay 
Where no admirers ever come, 
My heart, like an invisible drum, 
Goes beating a dead march all day.

Many a jewel of untold worth 
Lies slumbering at the core of earth, 
In darkness and oblivion drowned;

Many a flower has bloomed and spent 
The secret of its passionate scent 
Upon the wilderness profound.
