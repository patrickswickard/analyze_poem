Sepulchre

If on a dark and leaden night 
Some Christian soul, through charity, 
Bury your body, once so bright, 
By some ruined tenement's debris, 
At the dim hour when starlight ebbs 
And the stars doze against the dawn, 
There shall the spider weave his webs 
And there the viper breed his spawn.

There ceaselessly throughout the year 
Over your damned head you shall hear 
Dour wails of wolves and crazy rhymes 
Of starveling witches and grim snorts 
Of greybeard lechers at their sports 
And evil robbers hatching crimes.
