The Balcony

Inspirer of my youth, mistress beyond compare,
You who were all my pleasures, all my hopes and dreams!
Do you recall our cheerful room -- our evenings there,
Quiet and passionate? Like yesterday, it seems,
Inspirer of my youth, mistress beyond compare!

The evenings lighted by the hushed flame of the coal, 
The warm rose-misted twilights in the early springs, 
The balcony! How I adored you, body and soul! 
And, darling, we have said imperishable things 
The evenings lighted by the hushed flame of the coal.

How splendid were the long slow summer sunsets, too!
How large the world appeared to us! How strong and good
Life ran then in our veins! When I leaned close to you
I thought that I could breathe the perfume of your blood.
How splendid were the long slow summer sunsets, too!

The night would close around us like a dim blue wall, 
And your eyes flashed within the darkness, and the sweet 
Drug of your breath came over me. Do you recall 
How I would love to lie for hours holding your feet? 
The night would close around us like a dim blue wall.

I can relive the ecstasy that Time has slain; 
At moments I can feel myself between your thighs. 
What use to hope for anything like that again 
With someone else? What use to seek in any wise? 
I can relive the ecstasy that Time has slain.

Those cries, those long embraces, that remembered scent:
Can they be lost for ever? Will they not come round
Like stars, like suns, to blaze upon the firmament
Of future worlds, from the abyss we cannot sound?
-- O cries! O long embraces! O remembered scent!
