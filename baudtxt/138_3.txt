To One Who Is Too Gay

Your head, your gestures, and your air 
Are lovely as a landscape; smiles 
Rimple upon your face at whiles 
Like winds in the clear sky up there.

The grumpy passers that you graze 
Are dazzled by the radiant health, 
And the illimitable wealth 
Your arms and shoulders seem to blaze.

The glaring colours that, in showers, 
Clash in your clothes with such commotion, 
In poets' minds suggest the notion 
Of a mad ballet-dance of flowers.

These garish dresses illustrate 
Your spirit, striped with every fad. 
O madwoman, whom, quite as mad, 
I love as madly as I hate.

Sometimes in gardens, seeking rest, 
Where I have dragged my soul atonic, 
I've felt the sun with gaze ironic 
Tearing the heart within my breast.

The spring and verdure, dressed to stagger, 
Humiliate me with such power 
That I have punished, in a flower, 
The insolence of Nature's swagger.

And so, one night, I'd like to sneak, 
When night has tolled the hour of pleasure, 
A craven thief, towards the treasure 
Which is your person, plump and sleek.

To punish your bombastic flesh, 
To bruise your breast immune to pain, 
To farrow down your flank a lane 
Of gaping crimson, deep and fresh.

And, most vertiginous delight! 
Into those lips, so freshly striking 
And daily lovelier to my liking &mdash; 
Infuse the venom of my sprite.
