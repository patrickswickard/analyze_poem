Landscape

I want to write a book of chaste and simple verse, 
Sleep in an attic, like the old astrologers, 
Up near the sky, and hear upon the morning air
The tolling of the bells. I want to sit and stare, 
My chin in my two hands, out on the humming shops, 
The weathervanes, the chimneys, and the steepletops 
That rise like masts above the city, straight and tall, 
And the mysterious big heavens over all.

I want to watch the blue mist of the night come on, 
The windows and the stars illumined, one by one, 
The rivers of dark smoke pour upward lazily, 
And the moon rise and turn them silver. I shall see 
The springs, the summers, and the autumns slowly pass; 
And when old Winter puts his blank face to the glass, 
I shall close all my shutters, pull the curtains tight, 
And build me stately palaces by candlelight.

And I shall dream of luxuries beyond surmise,
Gardens that are a stairway into azure skies,
Fountains that weep in alabaster, birds that sing 
All day &mdash; of every childish and idyllic thing. 
A revolution thundering in the street below 
Will never lure me from my task, I shall be so 
Lost in that quiet ecstasy, the keenest still, 
Of calling back the springtime at my own free will, 
Of feeling a sun rise within me, fierce and hot, 
And make a whole bright landscape of my burning thought.
