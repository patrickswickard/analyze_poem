Damned Women

Like pensive cattle lying on the sand 
They scan the far horizon of the ocean, 
Foot seeking foot, hand magnetising hand, 
With sweet or bitter tremors of emotion.

Some with their hearts absorbed in confidences, 
Deep in the woods, where streamlets chatter free, 
Spell the loved names of childish, timid fancies, 
And carve the green wood of the fresh, young tree.

Others, like sisters wander, slow and grave, 
Through craggy haunts of ghostly emanations, 
Where once Saint Anthony was wont to brave 
The purple-breasted pride of his temptations.

Some by the light of resin-scented torches 
In the dumb hush of caverns seek their shrine, 
Invoking Bacchus, killer of remorses, 
To liven their delirium with wine.

Others who deal with scapulars and hoods 
Hiding the whiplash under their long train, 
Mingle, on lonely nights in sombre woods, 
The foam of pleasure with the tears of pain.

O demons, monsters, virgins, martyrs, you
Who trample base reality in scorn,
Whether as nuns or satyrs you pursue
The infinite, with cries or tears forlorn,

You, whom my soul has tracked to lairs infernal, 
Poor sisterhood, I pity and adore, 
For your despairing griefs, your thirst eternal, 
And love that floods your hearts for evermore!
