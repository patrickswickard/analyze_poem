The Portrait

Disease and Death, these are the ashes of
All that was fire, and warmed us heretofore.
Of those big eyes, so full of faith and love,
That mouth which stopped my heart, that endless store

Of kisses strong as dittany -- that whole 
Transport, that passion hotter than the sun, 
What now remains? A sorry thing, my soul! 
A faded sketch, in three pale crayons done;

Which, like myself, in dusty solitude
Subsides, and which with his injurious wing
Time daily rubs against. O black and rude

Assassin of proud Life and powerful Art: 
You cannot rob my memory of one thing, -- 
Her, that was all my triumph, all my heart.
