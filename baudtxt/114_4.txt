Don Juan in Hades

He found the wide bark rocking in the Stygian breeze 
And came aboard, having first paid Charon what he owed. 
A beggar, somber and haughty as Antisthenes, 
Seized the long oars with a revengeful gesture and rowed.

Writhing and tearing open their garments while he crossed, 
A crowd of disappointed females, herded there 
Along the bank like victims for a holocaust, 
Filled with a soft and bestial moaning the dark air.

Sganarelle laughed triumphantly, demanding his wage; 
Don Luis, still wrathful, pointed with a palsied hand 
To the unruly son who mocked him in his old age, 
Calling to witness the dead throngs upon that strand.

She whom he wed in church and loved a little while, 
Elvira, thin and trembling in her black robes of grief, 
Seemed to implore of her betrayer a last smile 
In memory of his first ardor, noble and brief.

The knight he murdered and whose ghost he had rebuked 
Stood now, a tall and cuirassed helmsman, at the stem; 
But the calm hero, leaning upon his rapier, looked 
Absently into the water, ignoring all of them.
