Spleen

When the cold heavy sky weighs like a lid 
On spirits whom eternal boredom grips, 
And the wide ring of the horizon's hid 
In daytime darker than the night's eclipse:

When the world seems a dungeon, damp and small, 
Where hope flies like a bat, in circles reeling, 
Beating his timid wings against the wall 
And dashing out his brains against the ceiling:

When trawling rains have made their steel-grey fibres 
Look like the grilles of some tremendous jail, 
And a whole nation of disgusting spiders 
Over our brains their dusty cobwebs trail:

Suddenly bells are fiercely clanged about
And hurl a fearsome howl into the sky
Like spirits from their country hunted out
Who've nothing else to do but shriek and cry &mdash; 

Then long processions without fifes or drums 
Wind slowly through my soul. Hope, weeping, bows 
To conquest. And atrocious Anguish comes 
To plant his black flag on my drooping brows.
