The Dream of a Curious Man

To F.N.

Do you know as I do, delectable suffering?
And do you have them say of you: "O! the strange man!"
&mdash; I was going to die. In my soul, full of love,
A peculiar illness; desire mixed with horror,

Anguish and bright hopes; without internal strife. 
The more the fatal hour-glass continued to flow, 
The fiercer and more delightful grew my torture; 
My heart was being torn from this familiar world.

I was like a child eager for the play, 
Hating the curtain as one hates an obstacle...
Finally the cold truth revealed itself:

I had died and was not surprised; the awful dawn 
Enveloped me. &mdash; What! is that all there is to it? 
The curtain had risen and I was still waiting.
