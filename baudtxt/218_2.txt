The Clock

Impassive clock! Terrifying, sinister god, 
Whose finger threatens us and says: "<i>Remember!</i> 
The quivering Sorrows will soon be shot 
Into your fearful heart, as into a target;

Nebulous pleasure will flee toward the horizon 
Like an actress who disappears into the wings; 
Every instant devours a piece of the pleasure 
Granted to every man for his entire season.

Three thousand six hundred times an hour, Second
Whispers: <i>Remember!</i> -- Immediately
With his insect voice, Now says: I am the Past
And I have sucked out your life with my filthy trunk!

<i>Remember! Souviens-toi,</i> spendthrift! <i>Esto memor!</i>
(My metal throat can speak all languages.)
Minutes, blithesome mortal, are bits of ore
That you must not release without extracting the gold!

Remember, Time is a greedy player 
Who wins without cheating, every round! It's the law. 
The daylight wanes; the night deepens; <i>remember!</i> 
The abyss thirsts always; the water-clock runs low.

Soon will sound the hour when divine Chance, 
When august Virtue, your still virgin wife, 
When even Repentance (the very last of inns!), 
When all will say: Die, old coward! it is too late!"
