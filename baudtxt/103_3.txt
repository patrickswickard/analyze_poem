Correspondences

Nature's a temple where each living column, 
At times, gives forth vague words. There Man advances 
Through forest-groves of symbols, strange and solemn, 
Who follow him with their familiar glances.

As long-drawn echoes mingle and transfuse 
Till in a deep, dark unison they swoon, 
Vast as the night or as the vault of noon &mdash; 
So are commingled perfumes, sounds, and hues.

There can be perfumes cool as children's flesh,
Like fiddIes, sweet, like meadows greenly fresh.
Rich, complex, and triumphant, others roll

With the vast range of all non-finite things &mdash; 
Amber, musk, incense, benjamin, each sings 
The transports of the senses and the soul.
