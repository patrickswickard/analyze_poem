Mist and Rain

O ends of autumn, winters, springtimes drenched with mud, 
Seasons that lull to sleep! I love you, I praise you 
For enfolding my heart and mind thus 
In a misty shroud and a filmy tomb.

On that vast plain where the cold south wind plays, 
Where in the long, dark nights the weather-cock grows hoarse, 
My soul spreads wide its raven wings 
More easily than in the warm springtide.

Nothing is sweeter to a gloomy heart
On which the hoar-frost has long been falling,
Than the permanent aspect of your pale shadows,

O wan seasons, queens of our clime
&mdash; Unless it be to deaden suffering, side by side 
In a casual bed, on a moonless night.
