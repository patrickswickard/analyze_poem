Moesta et Errabunda

Agatha, does your heart rise up and fly, 
Far from the city's black and sordid sea 
Towards a sea that's blue as any sky, 
And clear and deep as pure virginity? 
Agatha, does your heart rise up and fly?

The sea, the mighty sea, consoles our labour. 
What demon taught the sea with raucous verse 
To choir the organ which the winds belabour 
And lullaby our sorrows like a nurse? 
The sea, the mighty sea, consoles our labour.

Train, bear me; take me, ship, to other climes! 
Far, far! For here the mud is made of tears.
&mdash; Does Agatha's sad heart not say, at times, 
"Far from remorses, sorrows, crimes, and fears, 
Train, bear me; take me, ship, to other climes"?

How distant is that perfumed paradise! 
Where all is joy and love with azure crowned, 
Where all one loves is truly worth the price, 
And hearts in pure voluptuousness are drowned. 
How distant is that perfumed paradise!

But the green paradise of childish love,
Of races, songs, and kisses, and bouquets,
Of fiddles shrilling in the hills above,
And jars of wine, and woods, and dying rays &mdash; 
But the green paradise of childish love,

Innocent paradise of furtive joys, 
Is it far off as India or Hong Kong? 
Could it be conjured by a plaintive voice 
Or animated by a silver song &mdash; 
That far off paradise of furtive joys?
