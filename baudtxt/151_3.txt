Heautontimoroumenos

To J. G. F.

I'll strike you, but without the least
Anger &mdash; as butchers poll an ox,
Or Moses, when he struck the rocks &mdash; 
That from your eyelid thus released,

The lymph of suffering may brim
To slake my desert of its drought.
So my desire, by hope made stout,
Upon your salty tears may swim,

Like a proud ship, far out from shore. 
Within my heart, which they'll confound 
With drunken joy, your sobs will sound 
Like drums that beat a charge in war.

Am I not a faulty chord 
In all this symphony divine, 
Thanks to the irony malign 
That shakes and cuts me like a sword?

It's in my voice, the raucous jade! 
It's in my blood's black venom too! 
I am the looking-glass, wherethrough 
Megera sees herself portrayed!

I am the wound, and yet the blade! 
The smack, and yet the cheek that takes it! 
The limb, and yet the wheel that breaks it, 
The torturer, and he who's flayed!

One of the sort whom all revile, 
A Vampire, my own blood I quaff, 
Condemned to an eternal laugh 
Because I know not how to smile.
