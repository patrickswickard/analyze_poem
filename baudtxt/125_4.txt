The Dancing Serpent

Dear indolent, I love to see,
In your body bright,
How like shimmering silk the skin
Reflects the light !

On the deep ocean of your hair
Where perfume laves,
Odorous and vagabond sea
Of blue and brown waves,

Like a vessel awakening
When morning winds rise
My dreaming soul begins to sail
Toward remote skies.

Your two eyes that neither sweetness
Nor bitterness hold
Are two chilly gems mingled of
Iron and gold.

When you walk in rhythm, lovely
With abandonment,
You seem to be swayed by a wand,
A dancing serpent.

Your child's head under the burden
Of your indolence
Sways as delicately as a
Young elephant's,

And your body bends and straightens
Like a slender ship
That, plunging and rolling, lets the
Yards in water dip.

When, like a stream by thawing of
Glaciers made replete,
The water of your mouth rises
Up to your teeth,

I drink a Bohemian wine,
Powerful and tart,
A liquid sky that sows its stars
Within my heart !
