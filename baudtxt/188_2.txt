Cupid and the Skull

An Old Lamp Base

Cupid is seated on the skull 
Of Humanity;
On this throne the impious one 
With the shameless laugh

Is gaily blowing round bubbles
That rise in the air
As if they would rejoin the globes 
At the ether's end.

The sphere, fragile and luminous,
Takes flight rapidly,
Bursts	and spits out its flimsy soul 
Like a golden dream.

I hear the skull groan and entreat 
At every bubble:
"When is this fierce, ludicrous game 
To come to an end?

Because what your pitiless mouth
Scatters in the air,
Monstrous murderer &mdash; is my brain,
My flesh and my blood!"
