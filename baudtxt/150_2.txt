Conversation

You are a lovely autumn sky, clear and rosy! 
But sadness rises in me like the sea, 
And as it ebbs, leaves on my sullen lips 
The burning memory of its bitter slime.

-- In vain does your hand slip over my swooning breast; 
What it seeks, darling, is a place plundered 
By the claws and the ferocious teeth of woman. 
Seek my heart no longer; the beasts have eaten it.

My heart is a palace polluted by the mob;
They get drunk there, kill, tear each other's hair!
-- A perfume floats about your naked breast!...

O Beauty, ruthless scourge of souls, you desire it!
With the fire of your eyes, brilliant as festivals,
Bum these tatters which the beasts spared!
