Magnetic Horror

"Beneath this sky, so livid and strange, 
Tormented like thy destiny, 
What thoughts within thy spirit range 
Themselves? &mdash; O libertine reply."

&mdash; With vain desires, for ever torn 
Towards the uncertain, and the vast, 
And yet, like Ovid &mdash; I'll not mourn &mdash;
Who from his Roman Heaven was cast. 

O heavens, turbulent as the streams, 
In you I mirror forth my pride! 
Your clouds, which clad in mourning, glide, 

Are the hearses of my dreams, 
And in your illusion lies the hell, 
Wherein my heart delights to dwell.
