The Jewels

Naked was my dark love, and, knowing my heart, 
Adorned in but her most sonorous gems, 
Their high pomp decked her with the conquering art 
Of Moorish slave girls crowned with diadems.

Dancing for me with lively, mocking sound, 
This world of stone and metal, brittle and bright, 
Fills me with rapture who have always found 
Excess of joy where hue and tone unite.

Naked she lay, suffered love pleasurably 
To mould her, smiled on my desire as if, 
Profound and gentle as the rising sea, 
It rode the tide toward its appointed cliff.

A tiger, tamed, her eyes on mine, intent 
On lust, she sought all strange ways to please: 
Her air, half-candid, half-lascivious, lent 
A new charm to her metamorphoses.

In turn, her arms and limbs, her veins, her thighs,
Polished as nard, undulant as a swan,
Passed under my serene clairvoyant eyes
As belly and breasts, grapes of my vine, moved on.

Skilled in more spells than evil angels muster
To break the solace which possessed my heart,
Smashing the crystal rock upon whose luster
My quietude sat on its own, apart,

Her waist, awrithe, her belly enormously 
Out-thrust, formed strange designs unknown to us,
As if the haunches of Antiope 
Flowed from a body not yet Ephebus.

Slowly the lamplight sank, resigned to die.
Firelight pierced darkness, stud on glowing stud, 
Each time it heaved a sharply flaming sigh 
It steeped her amber flesh in pools of blood.
