The Wine of Lovers

Oh, what a splendour fills all space!
Without bit, spur, or rein to race, 
Let's gallop on the steeds of wine 
To heavens magic and divine!

Now like two angels off the track, 
Whom wild relentless fevers rack, 
On through the morning's crystal blue 
The swift mirages we'll pursue.

Now softly poised upon the wings 
That a sagacious cyclone brings, 
In parallel delirium twinned,

While side by side we surf the wind, 
We'll never cease from such extremes, 
To seek the Eden of our dreams!
