Duel

Two fighters rushed together: sabres bleak 
With crimson blood-gouts lit the air above. 
That clinking swordplay was the tender squeak 
Of youth , when it's a prey to bleating love.

The swords are splintered, like our youth, my darling, 
And now it's teeth and talons are the fashion. 
The clash of swords is child's play to the snarling 
Of hearts adult in ulcerated passion.

In the ravine by lynx and leopard haunted, 
Our heroes, wrestling heroes, roll undaunted. 
Rags of their skin flower red upon the gorse.

This gulf is hell, and peopled by our friends. 
Here, hellcat! Come, let's roll without remorse 
To celebrate a feud that never ends!
