The Skeleton Navy

I

Quaint anatomic plates are sold 
Along the quays in third-hand stalls 
Where tomes cadaverous and old 
Slumber like mummies in their palls.

In them the craftsman's skill combines 
With expert knowledge in a way 
That beautifies these chill designs 
Although the subject's far from gay.

One notes that, consummating these 
Mysterious horrors, God knows how, 
Skeletons and anatomies 
Peel off their skins to delve and plough.

II

Navvies, funereal and resigned,
From the tough ground with which you tussle
With all the effort that can find
Filleted spine or skinless muscle &mdash; 

O grave-snatched convicts, say what strange
Harvest you hope from such a soil
And who the farmer is whose grange
You would replenish with this toil.

Mean you to show (O evil-starred 
Exponents of too stark a doom) 
The promised sleep may yet be barred, 
Even from us, beyond the tomb;

That even extinction may turn traitor,
And Death itself, can be a lie;
And that perhaps, sooner or later,
Forever, when we come to die,

In some strange country, without wages, 
On stubborn outcrops delving holes, 
We'll push a shovel through the ages 
Beneath our flayed and blinding soles?
