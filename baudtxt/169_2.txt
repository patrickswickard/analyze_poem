<i>I Have Not Forgotten Our White Cottage</i>

I have not forgotten our white cottage, 
Small but peaceful, near the city, 
Its plaster Pomona, its old Venus, 
Hiding their bare limbs in a stunted grove. 
In the evening streamed down the radiant sun, 
That great eye which stares from the inquisitive sky. 
From behind the window that scattered its bright rays 
It seemed to gaze upon our long, quiet dinners, 
Spreading wide its candle-like reflections 
On the frugal table-cloth and the serge curtains.
