The Cracked Bell

Bitter and sweet it is on these long winter nights 
To sit before the fire and watch the smoking log 
Beat like a heart; and hear our lost, our mute delights 
Call with the carillons that ring out in the fog.

What certitude, what health, sounds from that brazen throat, 
In spite of age and rust, alert! O happy bell, 
Sending into the dark your clear religious note, 
Like an old soldier crying through the night, "All's well!"

I am not thus; my soul is cracked across by care;
Its voice, that once could clang upon this icy air,
Has lost the power, it seems, &mdash; comes faintly forth, instead,

As from the rattling throat of a hurt man who lies 
Beside a lake of blood, under a heap of dead, 
And cannot stir, and in prodigious struggling dies.
