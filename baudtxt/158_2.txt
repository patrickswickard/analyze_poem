Spleen

January, irritated with the whole city, 
Pours from his urn great waves of gloomy cold 
On the pale occupants of the nearby graveyard 
And death upon the foggy slums.

My cat seeking a bed on the tiled floor 
Shakes his thin, mangy body ceaselessly; 
The soul of an old poet wanders in the rain-pipe 
With the sad voice of a shivering ghost.

The great bell whines, the smoking log
Accompanies in falsetto the snuffling clock,
While in a deck of cards reeking of filthy scents,

My mortal heritage from some dropsical old woman, 
The handsome knave of hearts and the queen of spades 
Converse sinisterly of their dead love affair.
