Evening Harmony

The hour approacheth, when, as their stems incline, 
The flowers evaporate like an incense urn, 
And sounds and scents in the vesper breezes turn;
A melancholy waltz &mdash; and a drowsiness divine. 

The flowers evaporate like an incense urn, 
The viol vibrates like the wailing of souls that repine. 
A melancholy waltz &mdash; and a drowsiness divine, 
The skies like a mosque are beautiful and stern. 

The viol vibrates like the wailing of souls that repine;
Sweet souls that shrink from chaos vast and etern, 
The skies like a mosque are beautiful and stern, 
The sunset drowns within its blood-red brine. 

Sweet souls that shrink from chaos vast and etern, 
Essay the wreaths of their faded Past to entwine, 
The sunset drowns within its blood-red brine, 
Thy thought within me glows like an incense urn.
