Beatrice

In charred and ashen fields without a leaf,
While I alone to Nature told my grief,
I sharpened, as I went, like any dart,
My thought upon the grindstone of my heart &mdash; 
When by a troop of vicious demons led,
A great black cloud rushed down towards my head.
As loafers at a lunatic they leered
And in my face inquisitively peered.
With nods and signs, like dwarfed and apish elves,
They laughed, and winked, and spoke among themselves.

"This parody of Hamlet, take his measure, 
And contemplate the travesty at leisure. 
Is it not sad to see the puzzled stare, 
The halting gait, and the dishevelled hair 
With which this clownish actor, on half-pay, 
Because he is an artist in his way, 
Attempts to interest, in the griefs he sings, 
Eagles, and crickets, flowers, and running springs, 
And even us, the authors of his woe, 
Howling his sorrows as a public show?"

I could have dominated with my pride 
That horde of demons and the taunts they cried, 
Just by the mere aversion of my face &mdash; 
Had I not seen, amongst that evil race, 
(A crime that did not even daze the sun!) 
Queen of my heart, the peerless, only one, 
Laughing with them to see my dark distress, 
And giving them, at times, some lewd caress.
