Music

Oft Music, as it were some moving mighty sea, 
Bears me toward my pale 
Star: in clear space, or 'neath a vaporous canopy 
On-floating, I set sail. 

With heaving chest which strains forward, and lungs outblown, 
I climb the ridged steeps 
Of those high-piled clouds which 'thwart the night are thrown, 
Veiling its starry deeps. 

I suffer all the throes, within my quivering form. 
Of a great ship in pain, 
Now a soft wind, and now the writhings of a storm 

Upon the vasty main 
Rock me: at other times a death-like calm, the bare 
Mirror of my despair.
