The Wine of Lovers

To-day the Distance is superb, 
Without bridle, spur or curb, 
Let us mount on the back of wine 
For Regions fairy and divine! 

Let's, like two angels tortured by 
Some dark, delirious phantasy, 
Pursue the distant mirage drawn 
O'er the blue crystal of the dawn! 

And gently balanced on the wing 
Of some obliging whirlwind, we 
-- In equal rapture revelling --

My sister, side by side will flee, 
Without repose, nor truce, where gleams 
The golden Paradise of my dreams!
