L'Amour du mensonge

when I behold thee in thy nonchalance,
while from the dome the shards of music fall:
-- thy feet that slowly weave a weary dance
-- thy gaze a wearier flood engulfing all --

and when I watch thy brow so palely wan,
yet haunting in the gaslight's warm disguise,
-- where evening's torches paint the rose of dawn
-- thine eyes that hold me like a portrait's eyes

I cry: o rose bizarre, now bloomed afresh!
for regal memories crown her, towering, vast,
and all her heart's fruit, whose bruis&egrave;d flesh
is, like her body, riped for love at last.

art thou October fruit of sovereign wiles?
art thou an urn of tears for Sorrow's hours?
a fragrance wafting me to slumberous isles,
a roseleaf bed or funeral wreath of flowers?

some eyes are deep as though they always mourned
-- eyes where no secret pearl of sorrow lies:
fair empty caskets by no gems adorned,
profound and bottomless as ye, o skies!

mere seeming this? but if thy seeming be
a balsam in my heart, with truth at war?
dull or indifferent, what were that to me?
hail, mask of art! thy beauty I adore.
