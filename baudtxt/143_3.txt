The Flask

Perfumes there are which through all things can pass
And make all matter porous, even glass;
Old coffers from the Orient brought, whose locks
Grind sullenly when opening the box,

Or, in an empty house, some ancient chest, 
Where time and dust and gloom were long compressed, 
May yield a flask where memory survives, 
And a soul flashes into future lives.

A thousand thoughts, funereal larvae, laid 
Shuddering softly under palls of shade, 
May suddenly their soaring wings unfold, 
Stained azure, glazed with rose, or filmed with gold.

Intoxicating memory now flies 
Into the dusk, and makes us close our eyes: 
Vertigo draws the spirit which it grips 
Towards some dark miasma of eclipse:

Beside an ancient pit he makes her fall, 
Where Lazarus, sweet-scented, tears his pall 
And wakes the spectral corpse of some now-cold, 
Rancid, sepulchral love he knew of old.

So when I'm lost to human memory, thrown
In some old gloomy chest to fie alone,
A poor decrepit flask, cracked, abject, crusty
With dirt, opaque and sticky, damp and dusty,

I'll be your pall and shroud, beloved pest! 
The witness of your venom, and its test, 
Dear poison, angel-brewed with deadly art &mdash; 
Life, death, and dear corrosion of my heart.
