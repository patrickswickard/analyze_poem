The Evil Monk

The cloisters old, expounded on their walls 
With paintings, the Beatic Verity, 
The which -- ado'rning their religious halls, 
Enriched the frigidness of their Austerity. 

In days when Christian seeds bloomed o'er the land, 
Full many a noble monk unknown to-day, 
Upon the field of tombs would take his stand, 
Exalting Death in rude and simple way. 

My soul is a tomb where -- bad monk that I be --
I dwell and search its depths from all eternity, 
And nought bedecks the walls of the odious spot. 

Oh sluggard monk! when shall I glean aright 
From the living spectacle of my bitter lot, 
To mold my handy work and mine eyes' Delight?
