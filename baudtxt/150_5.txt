Causerie

You are an autumn sky, suffused with rose...
Yet sadness rises in me like the sea, 
And on my sombre lip, when it outflows. 
Leaves its salt burning slime for memory. 

Over my swooning breast your fingers stray; 
In vain, alas! My breast is a void pit 
Sacked by the tooth and claw of woman. Nay, 
Seek not my heart; the beasts have eaten it! 

My heart is as a palace plundered 
By the wolves, wherein they gorge and rend and kill, 
A perfume round thy naked throat is shed...

Beauty, strong scourge of souls, O work thy will! 
Scorch with thy fiery eyes which shine like feasts 
These shreds of flesh rejected by the beasts!
