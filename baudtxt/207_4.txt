Semper Eadem

"What in the world," you said, "has brought on this black mood, 
Climbing you as the sea climbs up a naked reef?"
&mdash; When once the heart has made its harvest (understood 
By all men, this) why, just to be alive is grief:

A pain quite simple, nothing mysterious at all, 
And like that joy of yours, patent to all we meet; 
Stop asking questions, then, I beg of you, and fall 
Silent a while, fair prober, though your voice be sweet.

Ah, yes, be silent, ignorant girl, always so gay, 
Mouth with the childlike laughter! More than Life, I say, 
Death has the power to hold us by most subtle ties.

My one fictitious comfort, kindly, let me keep: 
To plunge as into dreams into your lovely eyes, 
And in the shadow of your lashes fall asleep.
