The Ideal

It could ne'er be those beauties of ivory vignettes;
The varied display of a worthless age, 
Nor puppet-like figures with castonets, 
That ever an heart like mine could engage. 

I leave to Gavarni, that poet of chlorosis, 
His hospital-beauties in troups that whirl, 
For I cannot discover amid his pale roses 
A flower to resemble my scarlet ideal. 

Since, what for this fathomless heart I require 
Is -- Lady Macbeth you! in crime so dire;
-- An Aeschylus dream transposed from the South --

Or thee, oh great "Night"of Michael-Angelo born, 
Who so calmly thy limbs in strange posture hath drawn, 
Whose allurements are framed for a Titan's mouth.
