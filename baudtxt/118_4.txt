The Giantess

In times of old when Nature in her glad excess 
Brought forth such living marvels as no more are seen, 
I should have loved to dwell with a young giantess, 
Like a voluptuous cat about the feet of a queen;

To run and laugh beside her in her terrible games, 
And see her grow each day to a more fearful size, 
And see the flowering of her soul, and the first flames 
Of passionate longing in the misty depths of her eyes;

To scale the slopes of her huge knees, explore at will
The hollows and the heights of her &mdash; and when, oppressed
By the long afternoons of summer, cloudless and still,

She would stretch out across the countryside to rest, 
I should have loved to sleep in the shadow of her breast, 
Quietly as a village nestling under a hill.
