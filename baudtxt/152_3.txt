Praises of My Francisca

(Verses to a learned and devout Milliner)

Upon new chords of you I sing. 
And the new-born bud you bring 
From solitude, the pure heart's Spring.

Your brows should be with garlands twined 
Woman of delightful mind, 
Who our trespasses unbind.

As the wondrous balm of Lethe, 
Through thy kisses, I will breathe thee. 
All are magnetised who see thee.

When my vices, wild and stormy,
From my wonted courses bore me
It was You appeared before me,

Star of Oceans! you that alter 
Courses, when the pilots falter -- 
Take my heart upon your altar.

Cistern full of virtuous ruth, 
Fountain of eternal youth, 
Give to dumbness speech and truth!

What was dirty, you cremated, 
What uneven -- you equated, 
What was weak you re-created.

Inn, on the hungry roads I tramp, 
And, in the dark, a guiding lamp 
To steer the lost one back to camp.

To my strength add strength, O sweet 
Bath, where scents and unguents meet! 
Anoint me for some peerless feat!

Holy water most seraphic, 
On the lusts in which I traffic 
Flash your chastity ecstatic.

Bowl of gems where radiance dances. 
Salt that the holy bread enhances, 
And sacred wine -- your name is Frances!
