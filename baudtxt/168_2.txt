<i>The Kind-Hearted Servant of Whom You Were Jealous</i>

The kind-hearted servant of whom you were jealous, 
Who sleeps her sleep beneath a humble plot of grass, 
We must by all means take her some flowers. 
The dead, ah! the poor dead suffer great pains, 
And when October, the pruner of old trees, blows 
His melancholy breath about their marble tombs, 
Surely they must think the living most ungrateful, 
To sleep, as they do, between warm, white sheets, 
While, devoured by gloomy reveries, 
Without bedfellows, without pleasant causeries, 
Old, frozen skeletons, belabored by the worm, 
They feel the drip of winter's snow, 
The passing of the years; nor friends, nor family 
Replace the dead flowers that hang on their tombs.

If, some evening, when the fire-log whistles and sings 
I saw her sit down calmly in the great armchair, 
If, on a cold, blue night in December, 
I found her ensconced in a corner of my room, 
Grave, having come from her eternal bed 
Maternally to watch over her grown-up child, 
What could I reply to that pious soul, 
Seeing tears fall from her hollow eyelids?
