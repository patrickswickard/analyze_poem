Remorse Too Late

My dark and lovely thing, when you at length lie dead, 
And sleep beneath a slab of marble black as pitch; 
And have, for perfumed alcove and seductive bed, 
Only a rainy cavern and a hollow ditch;

When the oppressive stone upon your frightened breast 
Lets settle all its weight, and on your supple thighs; 
Restrains your heart from beating, flattens it to rest; 
Bends down and binds your feet, so roving, so unwise;

The tomb, that knows me well and reads my dream aright,
(What poet but confides his secret to the tomb?)
Will say to you some day during that endless night,

"They fare but ill, vain courtesan, in this cold room, 
Who bring here no warm memories of true love to keep!"
&mdash; And like remorse the worm will gnaw you in your sleep.
