The Denial of Saint Peter

What does God do with that huge storm of curses 
That rises daily to the seraphim? 
Like some gorged tyrant, while his guts he nurses, 
Our blasphemies are lullabies to him.

Martyrs and tortured victims with their cries 
Compose delicious symphonies, no doubt, 
Because, despite the blood they cost, the skies 
Can always do with more when they give out.

Jesus, remember, in the olive trees &mdash; 
In all simplicity you prayed afresh 
To One whom your own butchers seemed to please 
In hammering the nails into your flesh.

To see your godhead spat on by the like 
Of scullions, and of troopers, and such scum, 
And feel the thorns into your temples strike 
Which held, of all Humanity, the sum:

To feel your body's horrifying weight 
Lengthen your arms, to feel the blood and sweat 
Itching your noble forehead pale with fate, 
And as a target to the world be set,

Then did you dream of brilliant days of song,
When, the eternal promise to fulfill,
You mounted on an ass and rode along,
Trampling the flowers and palms beneath your feet,

When whirling whips, and full of valiant force, 
The money-lenders quailed at your advance: 
When you, in short, were master? Did remorse 
Not pierce your body further than the lance?

I am quite satisfied to leave so bored
A world, where dream and action disunite.
I'd use the sword, to perish by the sword.
Peter denied his Master?... He did right!
