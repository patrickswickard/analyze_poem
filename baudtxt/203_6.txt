La Chevelure

O fleece, that foams down unto the shoulders bare! 
O curls, O scents which lovely languidness exhale! 
Delight! to fill this alcove's sombre atmosphere 
With memories, sleeping deep within this tress of hair, 
I'll wave it in the evening breezes like a veil! 

The shores of Africa, and Asia's burning skies, 
A world forgotten, distant, nearly dead and spent, 
Within thy depths, O aromatic forest! lies. 
And like to spirits floating unto melodies, 
Mine own, Beloved! glides within thy sacred scent. 

There I will hasten, where the trees and humankind 
With languor lull beside the hot and silent sea;
Strong tresses bear me, be to me the waves and wind!
Within thy fragrance lies a dazzling dream confined 
Of sails and masts and flames &mdash; O lake of ebony! 

A loudly echoing harbour, where my soul may hold 
To quaff, the silver cup of colours, scents and sounds, 
Wherein the vessels glide upon a sea of gold, 
And stretch their mighty arms, the glory to enfold 
Of virgin skies, where never-ending heat abounds. 

I'll plunge my brow, enamoured with voluptuousness 
Within this darkling ocean of infinitude, 
Until my subtle spirit, which thy waves caress, 
Shall find you once again, O fertile weariness;
Unending lullabye of perfumed lassitude! 

Ye tresses blue &mdash; recess of strange and sombre shades, 
Ye make the azure of the starry Realm immense;
Upon the downy beeches, by your curls' cascades, 
Among your mingling fragrances, my spirit wades 
To cull the musk and cocoa-nut and lotus scents. 

Long &mdash; foraye &mdash; my hand, within thy heavy mane, 
Shall scatter rubies, pearls, sapphires eternally, 
And thus my soul's desire for thee shall never wane;
For art not thou the oasis where I dream and drain 
With draughts profound, the golden wine of memory?
