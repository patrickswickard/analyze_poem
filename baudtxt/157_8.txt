The Cracked Bell

'Tis bitter-sweet, when winter nights are long, 
To watch, beside the flames which smoke and twist, 
The distant memories which slowly throng, 
Brought by the chime soft-singing through the mist. 

Happy the sturdy, vigorous-throated bell 
Who, spite of age alert and confident, 
Cries hourly, like some strong old sentinel 
Flinging the ready challenge from his tent. 

For me, my soul is cracked; when, sick with care, 
She strives with songs to people the cold air 
It happens often that her feeble cries 

Mock the harsh rattle of a man who lies 
Wounded, forgotten, 'neath a mound of slain 
And dies, pinned fast, writhing his limbs in vain.
