Skeletons Digging

I

Among the anatomical plates
Displayed along the dusty quays,
Where many a dead book desiccates
Like an old mummy -- among these

Sad diagrams to which the grave
Fantasy and ironic skill
Of some forgotten artist have
Lent a mysterious beauty still,

One sees (for thus mere nerves and bones 
Were rendered life-like through his pains) 
Digging like laborers, skeletons 
And skinless men composed of veins.

II

Out of that stony soil which ye
Unceasingly upturn, with all
The strength of your stripped vertebrae
And fleshless thews -- funereal

Prisoners from the charnel pile! -- 
What do ye look for? Speak. What strange 
Harvest prepare ye all this while? 
What lord has bid you load his grange?

Do ye desire, O symbols clear
And frightful of a doom unguessed,
To demonstrate that even there,
In the deep grave, we have no rest -- 

That we can no more count as friend
Eternity than we can Time,
Death, too, being faithless in the end?
That we shall toil in dust and grime

For ever upon some field of shade, 
And harry the stiff sod, and put 
Over and over to the spade 
A naked and ensanguined foot?
