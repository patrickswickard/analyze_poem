Cats

All ardent lovers and all sages prize, 
&mdash; As ripening years incline upon their brows &mdash;
The mild and mighty cats &mdash; pride of the house &mdash;
That like unto them are indolent, stern and wise. 

The friends of Learning and of Ecstasy, 
They search for silence and the horrors of gloom;
The devil had used them for his steeds of Doom, 
Could he alone have bent their pride to slavery. 

When musing, they display those outlines chaste, 
Of the great sphinxes &mdash; stretched o'er the sandy waste, 
That seem to slumber deep in a dream without end: 

From out their loins a fountainous furnace flies, 
And grains of sparkling gold, as fine as sand, 
Bestar the mystic pupils of their eyes.
