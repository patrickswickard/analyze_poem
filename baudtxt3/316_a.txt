Well Far From Here

Here is the sacred hut
Where this much adorned woman
Calm and always prepared

One hand fanning her breasts
And her shoulder on the cushions
Listens to the fountains crying

It is the bedroom of Doroth√©e
The breeze and the water sing from afar
Their sobbing song disturbing
The rocking of this spoiled child

From high and low, with great care
Her delicate skin is rubbed
With oil that smells of resin
--In a corner flowers swoon
