The Invitation to the Voyage

My child, my sister,
Think of the sweetness
Of going down there to live together!
To love the leisure,
To love and to die
In a country which resembles you!
The damp suns
In the blurry skies
For my spirit have the charms
So mysterious
As treacherous eyes,
Glimmering through their tears.

There, there is no order but beauty,
Luxurious, calm and voluptuous.

The shiny furniture,
Polished through the years,
Would decorate our bedroom;
The rarest flowers
Mixing their odors
In waves that smell of amber,
The rich ceilings,
The deep mirrors,
The eastern splendor,
Where everything would speak
To the secret soul
Its soft native language.

There, there is no order but beauty,
Luxurious, calm and voluptuous.

There, on these canals
Sleep the vessels
Where the mood wanders;
It is to satisfy
Your least desire
Which comes at the end of the world.
The setting suns
Cover the fields,
The canals, the entire city,
With hyacinth and gold;
The world goes to sleep
In a luminous heat.

There, there is no order but beauty,
Luxurious, calm and voluptuous.
