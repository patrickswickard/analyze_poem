What will you say this evening, poor solitary soul

What will you say this evening, poor solitary soul
What will you say, my heart, heart once withered
To the very beautiful, to the very good, to the very dear
Whose divine regard has suddenly reflourished you

We will take pride in singing her praises
Nothing equals the sweetness of her authority
Her spiritual flesh has the perfume of the Angels
And her eye clothes us in the habit of clarity

What would be in the night and in solitude
What would be in the street and in the multitude
Its phantom dances in the air like a flame

Sometimes it speaks and says: "I am beautiful and I demand
That in loving me you love only Beauty
I am the guardian angel, the Muse and the Madonna."
