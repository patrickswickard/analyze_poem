The Sunset of Romanticism

How beautiful is the sun when it rises, fresh
Like an explosion that sends off its greeting
Happy is the one who can lovingly salute
The setting sun more glorious than a dream

I remember!  I had seen everything, flower, stream and furrow
Swoon beneath his eye like a beating heart
Let's run toward the horizon, it is late
Run fast at least to catch a fading ray

But I pursue in vain the retiring God
The irresistible Night establishes his empire
Black, humid, disastrous and full of shivers

The odor of the tomb swims in the shadows
And my timid foot next to the swamp
Disturbs he hidden toad and chilly snail
