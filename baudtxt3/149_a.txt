Irreparable

Can we smother the old lingering Remorse,
That lives, stirs and writhes
And feeds on us like the worm of death,
Like the caterpiller with the oak?
Can we smother the implacable Remorse?

In what potion, in what wine, in what tisane
Do we drown this old enemy,
Destroyer and gourmand like a courtesan,
Patient like the ant?
In what potion? In what wine? In what tisane?

Say, beautiful sorceress, oh! Say what you know,
Of this spirit filled with anguish
And, like a dying man crushed by wounds,
Who is bruised by the horse's foot,
Say, beautiful sorceress, oh! Say what you know,

To this sufferer whom the wolf already smells
And who is watched by the crow,
To this broken soldier! If he must despair
To have his cross and his tomb;
This sufferer whom the wolf already smells!

Can a black and muddy sky be lit?
Can the darkness be torn?
More dense than the pitch, without morning or night,
Without stars, without funereal lightning?
Can a black and muddy sky be lit?

Hope which shines in the windows of the Inn
Is snuffed out, is dead forever!
Without the moon, without rays of light, to find
Where the martyrs of an evil path are hosted!
The devil has extinguished the lights of the Inn!

Adorable sorceress, do you love the damned?
Say, do you know the irremissible?
Do you know Remorse, with poisoned features,
For whom our heart serves as a target?
Adorable sorceress, do you love the damned?

The irreparable gnaws with its cursed teeth
At our soul, pitiful monument,
And often, like the termite, attacks
The foundation of the building.
The irreparable gnaws with its cursed teeth!

I've seen sometimes, at the back of a banal theater
Enflamed by a sonorous orchestra,
A fay light ablaze in an infernal sky
A miraculous dawn;
I've seen sometimes, at the back of a banal theater

A being, of nought but light, gold and gauze,
Cast down enormous Satan;
But my heart, which never visits ecstasy,
Is a theater where we await
Always, always in vain, the being with wings of gauze!
