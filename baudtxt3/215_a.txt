A Taste for Nothingness

Dreary spirit, once in love with the fight
Hope, whose spur used to stir your ardor
No longer wants to mount you! Lie down shamelessly,
Old horse whose foot trips on every obstacle

Resign yourself, my heart; sleep your beastly sleep

Spirit vanquished, exhausted! For you, old marauder,
Love no longer has taste, no more than disagreement,
Therefore farewell, song of the brass and sigh of the flute!
Pleasures, tempt no more a heart sulking and somber

The adorable Spring has lost its perfume

And Time swallows me, minute by minute
Like an enormous snow stiffens a body
I contemplate from above the globe in its roundness
And no longer search there for the shelter of a shack

Avalanche, will you take me away in your fall?
