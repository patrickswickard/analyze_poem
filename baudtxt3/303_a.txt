Prayer of a Pagan

Ah, do not dampen your flame
Reheat my blunted heart
Voluptuousness, torture of the soul
Goddess! Hear me! I beseech you

Goddess spread out in the air
Flame of our underground
Fulfill an exhausted soul
Who dedicates to you a brazen song

Oh Pleasure, be always my queen!
Take the mask of a siren
Made of flesh and velvet

Or pour upon me your heavy sleep
In wine shapeless and mystical
Pleasure, elastic phantom
