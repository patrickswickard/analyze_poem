The Blind

Contemplate them, my soul, they who are truly repulsive!
The same as mannequins, vaguely ridiculous;
Terrible, strange like sleepwalkers;
Their dark globes staring at who knows what.

Their eyes, from which the divine spark has parted,
Stay raised to the sky as they gaze afar,
We never see them dreamily dip
Their heavy heads toward the paving stones.

Thus they cross the unending blackness,
This brother of eternal silence.  O city!
All the while around us you sing, laugh, and shout,

Infatuated with pleasure to the point of atrocity,
See!  I follow along as well!  But, more stupefied than they are,
I say: What do they seek in the sky, all those blind ones?
