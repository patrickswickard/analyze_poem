The Twilight of Evening

Behold the charming evening, friend of the criminal;
It comes like an accomplice, with the steps of a wolf
The sky closes slowly like a great alcove,
And the impatient man changes into a wild beast.

Oh evening, lovely evening, desired by he
Who in his arms without lying can say, Today
We have worked!  It is the evening that relieves
The spirits that devour a savage sadness,
The stubborn scholar whose forehead grows heavy,
And the bent worker who returns to his bed.
Yet the unhealthy demons in the atmosphere
Heavily waken, like businessmen,
And bang in their flight the shutters and awnings.
Against the lights tormented by the wind
Prostitution illuminates the streets;
Like an anthill it opens its exits;
Everywhere it makes a secret path,
Like an enemy making a swift attack;
It mixes in the breast of the city of filth
Like a worm that steals food from Mankind.
One can hear the kitchens whistling,
The theaters yelping, the orchestras snoring;
The tables, where gambling creates its delights,
Are filled with whores and crooks, their accomplices,
And the thieves, who show neither peace nor mercy,
Go soon to start their work, they as well,
And softly force open doors and boxes
To live a few days and to clothe their mistresses.

Recall, my love, in this grave moment,
And close your ears to this roar.
It is the hour where the sick ones' sorrow becomes bitter!
The dark night takes them by the throat;
They finish their destiny and go toward the common abyss;
The hospital filled with their suffering. More than one
Will no more come to seek the fragrant soup,
At the corner of the fire, this evening, with a loved one.

Still most people have never known
Of the softness of the hearth and have never really lived!
