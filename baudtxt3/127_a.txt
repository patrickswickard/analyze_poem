De Profundis Clamavi

I beg your pity, You, my only love,
From the bottom of the dark abyss where my heart has fallen.
It is a gloomy universe with a heavy horizon,
Where the night is swimming with horror and blasphemy;

A sun without heat glides overhead six months,
The other six are covered by the night;
It is a country more naked than the poles
No beasts, no streams, no greenery, no trees!

But no horror surpasses in the world
The cold cruelty of that icy sun
And this enormous night like vast chaos;

I envy the sort of vilest animals
Who can plunge themselves into a stupid sleep,
So slowly does unwind the skein of time!
