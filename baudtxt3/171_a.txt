The Ghost

Like the angels with a wild eye,
I will return to your alcove
And glide toward you noiselessly
With the shadows of the night;

And I will give you, my brown girl,
Kisses cold like the moon
And the caresses of a serpent
Crawling around a pit.

When livid morning comes,
You will find my place empty,
Where until evening it will be cold.

Like others do through tenderness,
In your life and your youth,
Me, I wish to rule by fear.
