The Two Good Sisters

Debauchery and Death are two lovable girls
Lavish with kisses and rich in health
Whose flanks are always virginal and draped with rags
Eternally laboring but never having given birth

To the sinister poet, enemy of families
Favored by Hell, a courtesan poorly endowed
Tombs and brothels display beneath their bowers
A bed which remorse has never frequented

And the coffin and alcove in fertile blasphemy
Offer us turn by turn, like two good sisters
Terrible pleasures and frightful softness

When do you wish to bury me, Debauchery with filthy arms
Oh Death, when will you come, her rival in attraction
Bringing your black cypress under her loathsome myrtle
