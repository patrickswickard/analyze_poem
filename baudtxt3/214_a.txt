Obsession

Great forest, you frighten me like the cathedrals;
You howl like the wind; and in our damned hearts,
Chambers of eternal grief where old death rattles sound,
The echoes of your De Profondis respond.

I hate you, Ocean, your bounds and tumults,
My mind finds them in itself. It laughs bitterly
At the vanquished man, full of sobs and insults;
I hear the enormous laughter of the sea

How you will please me, oh Night! Without these stars
Whose light speaks a familiar language!
So I search the void, and the black, and the nude!

But the darkness itself is a canvas where dwell,
Spraying toward my eyes by the thousands,
Disappeared beings with familiar features.
