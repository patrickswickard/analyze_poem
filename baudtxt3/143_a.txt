The Flask

It is the strongest perfume for which all
Is porous, even said to penetrate glass.
In opening a coffer from the East
Whose lock squeaks and cries out reluctantly,

Or left in a house deserted, in an armoire
Full of the acrid smell of time, dusty and black,
Sometimes an old flask is found, bringing a memory
Spraying forth a soul returned to life

A thousand thoughts that slept in deathly cocoons
Simmering softly in the heavy darkness
Which disengaged their wings from taking flight
Tinted with blue, glazed with pink, plated with gold

There is the living memory of flight
Which troubles the air; eyes close; the Vertigo
Seizes the conquered soul, shoving it with both hands
Toward a dark pit of human miasmas

It lands next to a secular abyss
Where as stinking Lazarus tears at his shroud,
A spectral cadaver of a rancid old love
Awakens and moves, charming and sepulchral.

Thus when I would be lost to Man's memory,
In the corner of some sinister armoire
When one would throw me away, sorry old flask
Decrepit and dusty, dirty, abject, viscous and cracked

I would be your coffin, lovable pestilence!
The witness of your force and virulence,
Dear poison prepared for the angels, liqueur
That gnaws at me, oh the life and death of my heart!
