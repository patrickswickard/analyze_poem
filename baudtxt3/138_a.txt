To one who is too gay

Your head, your mannerisms, your way
Is lovely, like a beautiful countryside
The smile plays upon your face
Like a fresh wind in the clear sky

The sorrowful ones that pass you by
Are dazzled by the healthy glow
That radiates, brilliant and clear,
From your bare arms and shoulders

The bold bright colors that you use
To style yourself infuse within
The poet's soul the vision of
A whirling dance of flowers

These crazy gowns are the emblem
Of your gaudy spirit
A madness that maddens me
I despise you as I adore you

At times in a lovely garden
Where I would drag my apathy
I would feel the irony
As sunlight ripped into my breast

And the springtime and the green
Had so beclowned my heart
That I did crush a flower for spite
To punish Nature's insolence

And so I would like, one late night
When the hour of pleasure sounds
To creep up noiseless, cowardly
Upon your body's sweet delight

To cruelly whip your joyous flesh
Leave bruises on your innocent breast
Inflict in your astonished flank
A cruel wound, long and deep

And then--such dizzy gentleness!
Through this new set of lips which are
More shiny and more sweet by far
Inject my venom, my sweet girl.
