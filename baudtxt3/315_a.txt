The Ransom

The man who has, for paying his ransom,
Two fields of tuff, deep and rich,
Which he must stir and clear
With the iron of reason;

To obtain the slightest rose,
To coax out a bit of grain,
With salty tears from his grey forehead
Ceaselessly he must water it.

One is art, another is love.
To render the judge favorable,
While strict justice
Appears the terrible day,

He will have to climb into the granary
Full of harvests and flowers
From which the shapes and the colors
Win the suffrage of the angels.
