The Possessed

The sun is covered with a veil. Like him,
O moon of my life, swaddle yourself in shadow
Sleep or smoke to your delight; be mute, be dark
And plunge entirely into the gulf of Boredom

I love you thus! Yet, if you wish today
Like an eclipsed star that leaves the penumbra,
Strut forth in the place encumbered by Madness,
It is well! Charming dagger, leap from your sheath!

Light the pupil with the flame of eternity
Light desire with the gazes of rubes!
All of you to me is pleasure, morbid or petulant

Be as you wish, black night, red dawn,
There is no fiber of my being
Which doesn't cry: Oh my dear Beelzebub, I love you!
