Don Juan in Hell

When Don Juan descended to the subterranean waters
And as he had given his obol to Charon,
That shadowy beggar with an eye proud as Antisthene
Seized both the oars with vengeful arms

Baring their pendulous breasts with their dresses open
The women twisted on the black ground
And, like a great herd of sacrificial victims,
Trailed behind him with a long howl

Sganarell was laughing as he demanded his payment
And Don Luis with a trembling finger
Showed to the wandering dead on the banks
The audacious son who had mocked his pale brow

Shivering with mourning, the thin and chaste Elvire
Next to the spiteful spouse, her former lover,
Seemed to implore him with a great smile
Which shone with the softness of his first promise

Straight ahead in his armor, a great stone man
Stood at the helm and cut the black flood
But the calm hero, leaning on his sword
Kept regarding the wake and looked nowhere else
