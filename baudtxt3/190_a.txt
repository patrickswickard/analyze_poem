Abel and Cain

I

Race of Abel, sleep, drink and eat;
God smiles on you indulgently.

Race of Cain, down in the mire
Creep and die in misery.

Race of Abel, your sacrifice
Flatters the noses of Seraphim!

Race of Cain, all your torments
Will they last until the very end?

Race of Abel, watch your crop
And your herd prosper well;

Race of Cain, your entrails howl
In hunger like a poor old dog.

Race of Abel, warm your belly at
The hearths of patriarchs of old;

Race of Cain, in your cave
Poor jackal, shiver in the cold!

Race of Abel, love and breed!
Your gold will multiply as well.

Race of Cain, with heart that burns,
Beware of its great appetites.

Race of Abel, you believe and graze
Like insects chewing on tree leaves!

Race of Cain, along the roads
Drag your desperate family.

II

Ah, Race of Abel, your carrion
Will fertilize the fuming soil!

Race of Cain, your work is not
Complete yet, it is not enough;

Race of Abel, here's your shame:
The sword is broken by the spear!

Race of Cain, climb to the sky,
And throw God down onto the Earth!
