The Living Flame

They walk before me, these eyes full of light
Which a wise angel has no doubt made magnetic
They walk, these divine brothers who are my brothers
Dazzling my eyes with their diamond studded fire

Saving me from every trap and grave sin
They guide my path on the road to Beauty
They are my servants and I am their slave
All my being obeys this living flame

Charming eyes, you shine with a mystic clarity
Which has the candles burning broad daylight, the Sun
The sun reddens, but it does not extinguish your living flame

They celebrate Death, you sing of the Awakening
You, marching and singing my soul's awakening
Stars whose flame no sun can dim
