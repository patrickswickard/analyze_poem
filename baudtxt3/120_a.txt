Exotic Perfume

When, both eyes closed, in a warm autumn evening,
I breathe in the odor of your warm bosom,
I see unroll the happy shores
Where the fires of the monotone sun are dazzling;

A lazy island where nature gives
Remarkable trees and savory fruits;
Men whose bodies are slim and vigorous
And women whose eyes have a surprising candor.

Guided by your odor toward the charming climates,
I see a port full of sails and masts
Still exhausted from the sea's waves,

While the perfume of green tamarind trees,
Which circles through the air and fills the nostrils,
Mixes in my soul with the song of the sailors.
