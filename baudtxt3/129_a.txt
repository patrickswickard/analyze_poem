Lethe

Come upon my heart, soul cruel and deaf,
Beloved tiger, monster with a lazy air;
Long I've wanted to plunge my trembling fingers
Into the thickness of your heavy mane;

In your skirts full of your perfume
Burying my saddened head,
And breathing, like a withered flower,
The soft stench of my defunct love.

I want to sleep! To sleep more than live!
In a sleep as soft as death,
I would spread my kisses without remorse
On your beautiful body, polished like copper.

Nothing else would serve then to engulf
My stifled sobs like the abyss of your bed;
Mighty oblivion lives upon your lips,
And the Lethe flows forth through your kisses.

My destiny from here on, delightful one,
I will obey like one who is predestined;
Docile martyr, innocent condemned,
Whose fervor only makes the torture worse,

To drown my rancor, I will suckle upon
The nepenthe and the good hemlock
From the sharp tips of this charming bosom
Which has never held a heart within.
