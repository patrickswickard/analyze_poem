Spleen

I have more memories than if I had lived a thousand years

A great chest of drawers encumbered by bills
By verse, love notes, lawsuits, romances
With heavy hair rolled with receipts
Holding fewer secrets than my sad brain
It is a pyramid, an immense cave
That contains more deaths than a common grave
I am a cemetery abhorred by the moon
Where long worms crawl along like remorse
Who always attack the dearest of my dead
I am an old boudoir full of faded roses
Where lies all in a jumble outdated fashions
Where the plaintive pastels and the pale Bouchers
Alone breathe the odor of an uncorked flagon

Nothing equals in langour the lamed days
When all the heavy flakes of the yearly snows
Boredom, the fruit of sad apathy
Takes on the proportions of immortality
From that day forward you, oh living matter
Than granite surrounded by a vague terror
Sighing at the bottom of a misty Sahara
An old sphinx ignorant of the unworried world
Forgotten on the map and whose fierce mode
Sings only in the rays of the setting sun
