Spleen

January, irritated by the entire city,
From its urn of great floods pours a cold darkness
In the pale inhabitants next to the cemetery
And mortality in the misty suburbs.

My cat on the floor in search of his litter
Restlessly stalks around, meager and mangy;
The soul of an old poet wanders in the gutter
With the sad voice of a chilly phantom.

The bumblebee laments, and the steaming log
Accompanies in falsetto the sickly clock
While in a card deck full of dirty perfumes,

The inheritance of an old dropsical woman,
The fair knave of hearts and the queen of spades
Chat in sinister tones about their lost love.
