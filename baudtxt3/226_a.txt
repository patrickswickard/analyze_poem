Danse Macabre

For Ernest Christophe

Proud as one living of her noble stature
With her fat bouquet, her handkerchief and gloves
She has the nonchalance and casualness
Of a thin coquette with an extravagant attitude

Was a slimmer waistline ever seen at the ball?
Her showy dress with its royal ampleness
Drapes with abandon over a thin foot pinched
Into a decorated slipper, pretty as a flower

The ruffles that play next to her collarbone
Like a lascivious stream that rubs against the rocks
Defend modestly against the laughable lechers
The morbid temptation that she wants to keep hidden

Her deep eyes are made of emptiness and darkness
And her skull, coiffed artfully with flowers
Oscillates softly on her frail vertebrae
Oh charm of a void, madly adorned

You might be called a caricature by those
Who don't understand, lusting after flesh,
The unnamed elegance of the human framework
You answer, great skeleton, my most exquisite taste!

Do you come to trouble with your powerful grimace
The party of Life? Or some old desire
Which still spurs on the living carcass
You credulously push to the sabbat of Pleasure

At the song of the violins, by candlelight
Do you hope to chase away your mocking nightmare
And do you come to ask the torrent of orgies
To refresh the hell that's lit within your heart?

Inexhaustible well of foolishness and faults
Eternal alambic of antique sadness!
Through the trellis that curves along your sides
I see, still moving, the insatiable asp

To tell the truth, I cringe at your coquetry
I find no worthy prize for your efforts
Who of mortal hearts understands the mockery?
The charms of the horror enchant only the strong!

The abyss of your eyes, full of horrible thoughts,
Exhales dizziness, and the careful dancers
Only contemplate with bitter nausea
Your thirty-two teeth in an eternal smile

But who has not embraced a skeleton
And who has not fed on things of the tomb
What matters the perfume, the way you're arrayed
He who finds you disgusting thinks himself fair

Noseless dancer, irresistible whore
Say therefore to the dancers who find offense:
"Proud dears, despite the art of powder and rouge
You all still smell of death!  Oh masked skeletons

Withered Antinous, dandies with smooth faces
Varnished cadavers, hoary philanderers
The eternal shake of the danse macabre
Carries you along to places you do not know

From the cool quays of the Seine to the burning banks of the Ganges
The mortal troupe jumps and swoons, not seeing
In a hole in the sky the trumpet of the Angel
Sinisterly gaping like a black blunderbuss

In every climate, under every sun, Death admires you
In your contortions, laughable humanity
And often, like you, perfumes herself in myrrh
Mixes her irony with your insanity!"
