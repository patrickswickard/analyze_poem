Harmony of the Evening

The season has come when, swinging on their stems,
Every flower diffuses its scent like a censer
The sounds and perfumes turn in the evening air
A waltz melancholic and lazily dizzy

Every flower diffuses its scent like a censer
The violin quivers like a heart afflicted
A waltz melancholic and lazily dizzy
The sky is sad and beautiful like a great altar

The violin quivers like a heart afflicted
A tender heart, that hates the void vast and black
The sky is sad and beautiful like a great altar
The sun has drowned in its congealing blood

A tender heart, that hates the void vast and black
Collects every scrap the luminous past
The sun has drowned in its congealing blood
Your memory shines in me like a monstrance
