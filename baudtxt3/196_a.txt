The Wine of Lovers

Today the universe is splendid!
Without bits, without spurs, without bridle,
We leave by horse on the wine
For a heaven fairylike and divine!

Like two angels who are tortured
By an implacable fever
In the crystal blue of the morning
We follow the faraway mirage!

Softly balanced on the wing
Of intelligent turbulence,
In a parallel delirium,

My sister, side by side swimming,
We flee without repose or truce
Toward the paradise of my dreams!
