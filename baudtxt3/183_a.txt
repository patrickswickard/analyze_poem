The Fountain of Blood

Sometimes it seems my blood pours out in a flood,
Spurting like a fountain in rhythmic sobs.
I hear how it flows out with a long murmur,
But I feel around in vain to find the wound.

Throughout the city, like a tournament field,
It seeps out, turning paving stones into islands,
Quenching the thirst of every creature,
And coloring all of nature in red.

In wine I've oft looked for confounding distractions
To assuage for a day the terror that haunts me;
But wine makes the eye clearer and makes the ear keener!

I have sought through love an oblivious sleep;
But love is to me nought but a bed of nails
Which serves up a drink for these cruel girls!
