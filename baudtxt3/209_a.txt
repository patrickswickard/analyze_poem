To a Madonna

In the manner of a votive of the Spanish style

I want to build for you, Madonna, my mistress
An underground altar at the bottom of my distress
And carve in the darkest corner of my heart
Far from mundane desire and mocking looks
A niche, blue and completely enameled
Where you would stand, a marvelous statue
With my polished verse, a trellis of pure metal
Studded with clever rhymes in crystal
I would make for your head an enormous crown
And from my jealousy, o mortal Madonna,
I would tailor a coat, in a barbaric fashion
Stiff and heavy and lined with suspicion
Which, like a fortification, would encase your charm
Not embroidered with pearls but with my tears
Your dress, that would be my shivering Desire
Undulating, my desire which rises and falls
On the peaks it balances, in the valleys it rests
And clothes you, kissing your whole body, pale and pink
I would make for you from my respect some beautiful slippers
Of satin, humbled by your divine feet
Which encase them in a soft embrace
Like a faithful mold, retaining their form
If I could not despite my diligent skill
I would craft for a stepping stone a silvery moon
I would give you the serpent that bites my entrails
Under your heels, for you to tread on and taunt
Victorious queen, fertile with redemption
This monster swollen with hatred and spit
You would see my thoughts, arranged like the candles
In front of the flowered altar of the Queen of Virgins
Casting stars on the reflection of the ceiling painted blue
And looking down always on your eyes full of fire
And because all of me admires and cherishes you
All will become resin and incense, frankincense and myrrh
And ceaselessly toward your summit white and snowy
Would climb through the clouds my spirit so stormy

Finally to complete your role as Mary
And to mix love with a bit of barbarity
Dark desire! Of the Seven Deadly Sins
As a torturer full of remorse, I would make seven knives
Well sharpened, and like a deranged juggler
Taking the depths of your love as a target
I would plant them in your panting heart,
Your sobbing heart, your bleeding heart.
