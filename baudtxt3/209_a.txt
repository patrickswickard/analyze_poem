To a Madonna

In the manner of a votive of the Spanish style

I want to build for you, Madonna, my mistress
An underground altar at the bottom of my distress
And dig in the darkest corner of my heart
Far from mundane desire and mocking looks
A niche, blue and completely enameled
WHere you would stand, a marvelous statue
With my polished verse, a trellis of pure metal
WIsely clustered with rhymes in crystal
I would make for your head an enormous crown
And in my jealousy, o mortal Madonna,
I would tailor a coat, in the Berber fashion
Stiff and heavy and lined with suspicion
Which, like a fortification, would encase your charm
Not embroidered with pearls but with my tears
Your dress, that would be my shivering Desire
Undulating, my desire which rises and falls
On the peaks it balanes, in the valleys it rests
and dreams of kissing your whole body, pale and pink
I would make for you from my respect some beautiful slippers
Of satin, for your divine humble feet
Which, encased in a soft constraint
Like a faithful mold, retaining its imprint
If I could not despite my diligent skill
I would craft for a stepping stone a silvery moon
I would give you the serpent that bites my entrails
Under your nails, for you to injure and taunt
Victorious queen, fertile with redemption
This monster inflated with hate and spit
You would see my thoughts, arranged like the candles
In front of the flowered altar of the Queen of Virgins
Casting stars on the reflection of the ceiling painted blue
I would always gaze into your eyes full of fire
And like all in my that you cherish and admire
Made of resin, incense, frankincense, and myrrh
And ceaselessly toward your summit white and snowy
Would climb through the clouds my spirit so stormy

Finally to complete your role as Mary
And to mix love with a bit of barbarity
Dark desire! Of the Seven Deadly Sins
Wracked full of remorse I would make seven knives
Well sharpened, and like a deranged juggler
Taking from the depths of my love as a goal
I would plant them in your panting heart,
In your sobbing heart, in your streaming heart.
