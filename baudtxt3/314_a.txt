The Water Fountain

Your gorgeous eyes are tired, poor beloved!
Rest for a while, without opening them,
In this nonchalant pose
Where pleasure surprised you
In the running of the water fountain which chatters
And never hushes, night or day,
The ecstasy softly remains
Where this evening I have dived into love

The sheaf blooming
The thousand flowers
To which rejoiceful Phoebe
Gives her colors
Fall like a rain
Of weighty tears

Thus your soul which ignited
The burning lightning of lust
Rushes, rapid and hardy
Toward the vast enchanted skies
Then it spreads, dying,
In a flood of sad languor
Which through an invisible slope
Descends to the depth of my heart

The sheaf blooming
The thousand flowers
To which rejoiceful Phoebe
Gives her colors
Fall like a rain
Of weighty tears

Oh you who the night renders so fair
So soft to me, leaning against your breasts
To listen to the eternal complaint
Which sobs in the pools!
Moon, beautiful sound, blessed night,
Trees which shiver around us
Your pure melancholy
Is the mirror of my love

The sheaf blooming
The thousand flowers
To which rejoiceful Phoebe
Gives her colors
Fall like a rain
Of weighty tears
