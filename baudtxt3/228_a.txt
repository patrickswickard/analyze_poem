Parisian Dream

For Constantine Guys

I

The image of this wretched landscape
Which no mortal has ever seen
Its image, vague and distant,
Still this morning pleases me

Sleep is full of miracles
Through a peculiar caprice
I have banned from this spectacle
Irregular greenery

And, the proud painting of my genius
I savor in my tableau
The intoxicating monotony
Of metal, marble and water

Babel of steps and arcades
It was an infinite palace
Full of pools and flowing fountains
Of gold, dull or burnished

And the heavy waterfalls
Like curtains made of crystal
Suspended themselves, in bloom,
From the walls of metal

Not the trees, or the columns
Surrounded by dormant ponds
Where gigantic naiads
Admired themselves like women

The ribbons of water poured out, blue
Between the quays pink and green
Millions of leagues toward
The confines of the universe

There were incredible stones
And magical floods, it was
Immense dazzling glaciers
Through which everything was reflected

Insouciant and taciturn,
The Ganges in the sky
Poured the treasure of its urns
In the gulfs of diamond

Architect of my fairyland
I made, as I wanted,
A tamed ocean pass
Under a tunnel of jewels

And everything, even the color black
Seems junk, clear, iridescent
The liquid chases its glory
In the crystallized rays

No star elsewhere, no vestiges
Of the sun even at the sky's edge
Lit these incredible things
That blazed with a personal flame!

And above these moving marvels
Hovered (terrible novelty!
All for the eye, none for the ear)
The silence of eternity

II

On reopening my eyes full of flame
I've seen the horror of my hovel
And felt reenter my soul
The point of cursed worries

The clock with its morbid accents
Sounded the noontide brutally
And the sky poured the darkness
Upn the sad blunted world
