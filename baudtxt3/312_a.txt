The Rebel

A furious angel from deep in the sky like an eagle,
Seized a fistful of the hair of an unbeliever,
And said, shaking him: "You know the rule!
(Since I am your good angel, do you hear?) I want this!

Know that you must love, without grimacing,
The poor, the mean, the tortured, the dazed,
To have the power to make for Jesus, when He comes,
A triumphant carpet with your charity!

Such is Love! Before your heart grows jaded,
Rekindle your ecstasy in the glory of God;
It is the true delight of lasting charms!"

And the Angel, my faith, chastising as much as he loves,
Beats this anathema with his giant fists;
But the damned one always responds: "I don't want to!"
