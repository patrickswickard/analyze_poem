Verse for the Portrait of M. Honor√© Daumier

The one whose portrait we offer you
And whose art, the most subtle of all,
Teaches us to laugh at ourselves
This one, reader, is a sage

He is a satirist, a mocker,
But the energy with which
He paints Evil and its consequences
Shows the beauty of his heart

His laughter is not the grimace
Of Melmoth or of Mephisto
Or the torch of the Fury Alecto
Which burns but makes us shiver

Their laughter, alas, is nothing
But a sad caricature of gaiety
His radiates, generous and free
Like a sign of his kindness
