Moesta et errabunda

Tell me, does your heart sometimes take flight, Agatha,
Far from the black ocean of the filthy city
Toward another ocean where the splendor flashes,
Blue, clear, deep as virginity?
Tell me, does your heart sometimes take flight, Agatha?

The sea, the vast sea, consoles our labors!
What demon endowed the sea, hoarse singer
Who accompanies the immense organ of groaning winds,
With the sublime function of rocking a cradle?
The sea, the vast sea, consoles our labors!

Carry me, wagon! Pick me up, frigate!
Far! Far! Here the mud is made of our tears!
Is it true that sometimes the sad heart of Agatha
Says: Far from remorse, from crimes, from pains,
Carry me, wagon! Pick me up, frigate?

How faraway you are, perfumed paradise,
Where under a blue clearness there is only love and joy,
Where all that is loved is worthy of being loved,
Where the heart drowns itself in pure delight!
How faraway you are, perfumed paradise!

But the green paradise of childish loves,
The outings, the songs, the kisses, the bouquets,
The vibrant violins behind the hills,
With the pitchers of wine in the evening, in the groves,
But the green paradise of childish loves,

The innocent paradise, full of furtive pleasures,
Is it already farther than India and China?
Can we recall it with plaintive cries,
And still bring it to life with a silvery voice,
The innocent paradise, full of furtive pleasures?
