I give you these verses so that if my name

I give you these verses so that if my name,
A vessel favored by a great wind
Happily sails off to faraway epochs
And some future evening makes the minds of men dream

Your memory will remain, like an uncertain fable
Fatiguing the reader, like a drum,
And through a fraternal and mystical chain
Will linger suspended by my haughty verse

Tread with a light foot and a serene regard
On the stupid mortals who have bitterly judged you
Statue with eyes of jet, angel with a bronze forehead!
