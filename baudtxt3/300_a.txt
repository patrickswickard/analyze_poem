For Theodore de Banville

You have seized the cries of the Muse
With such a grip that one who saw
This mastery and nonchalance
Would think you a pimp overpowering his girl.

Your eye bright and full of precocious fire,
You have lazily shown the pride of an architect
With your phrasing audacious but still so correct
One can see what you'll be in your maturity.

O Poet! Our blood flees from every pore;
Is it perchance the robe of the Centaur
Which changed every vein to a deathly stream

Which was dyed three times in the subtle spit
Of the monstrous and vindictive serpents
Strangled by young Hercules in his crib?
