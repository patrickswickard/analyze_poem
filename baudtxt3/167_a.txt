Twilight at Dawn

Reveille was ringing out at the barracks yard,
And the morning wind was blowing over the lanterns.

It was the hour where the swarm of evil dreams
Made the tanned children toss in their beds;
Where, like a blood-red eye that pulses and moves,
The lamp of the day makes a red stain;
Where the soul, under the weight of a body unpleasant and heavy,
Imitates the battle of the lamp and the day.
Like a face full of tears dried by the breeze,
The air is full of the shivers of fleeing things,
And the man is tired of writing, the woman tired of loving.

The houses there begin to let off smoke.
The prostitutes, their eyelids livid,
Mouths open, sleep full of stupid dreams;
The poor women, their thin cold breasts hanging,
Were blowing on their embers and on their fingers.
It was the hour where among the cold and miserliness
The pains of women in labor were worsened;
Like a sobbing gasp through frothing blood
The faraway cock's song tore through the hazy air;
The buildings were bathing in a sea of fog,
And the suffering ones in the depths of the hospices
were pushing out their death rattles in unequal hiccups.
The debauchees were returning, worn out by their work.

Dawn shivering in a robe green and red
Was advancing slowly on the deserted Seine
And somber Paris, rubbing its eyes,
Was grasping its tools like an aged workman.
