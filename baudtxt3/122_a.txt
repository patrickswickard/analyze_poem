You Would Fuck the Whole World in Your Alley

You would fuck the whole world in your alley,
Whorish woman! Boredom makes your soul cruel.
To exercise your teeth on this peculiar game,
You would need every day a new heart on the rack.
Your eyes, lit thus with boutiques
And with flamboyant yews in the public parties,
Insolently use a borrowed power,
Without ever knowing the law of their beauty.

Machine blind and deaf, fertile with cruelty!
Instrument of salvation, drinker of the world's blood,
How have you no shame and how have you not
Before every mirror seen your charms fade?
The grandeur of this evil which you believe wise
Has it never made you shrink in terror,
When Nature, great in its hidden designs,
Makes use of you, oh woman, oh queen of sins,
Of you, vile animal, to mold a genius?

Oh muddy grandeur! Sublime ignominy!
