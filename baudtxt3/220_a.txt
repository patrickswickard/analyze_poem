The Swan

For Victor Hugo

I

Andromache, I think of you! This little river
Poor and sad mirror where once glimmered
The immense majesty of your widowhood's sorrows
This lying Simois who grows with your tears

Has suddenly seeded my fertile memory
As I cross the new Carrousel
Old Paris is no more (the form of a city
Changes, alas, more quickly than the heart of a mortal)

I only see in memory this field full of stalls
This pile of shafts and casks
The grass, the fat green stained blocks in puddles of water
And, shining on the tiles, the confused bric-a-brac

In days of old there stood a menagerie
There I saw, one morning, at the hour when
Under clear cold skies Work wakes, and on the streets
A gloomy storm pushes through the silent air

A swan who had escaped out of his cage
And, his feet scraping against the dry flagstones
He led his white plumage on the bumpy ground
Near a dry stream the beast opened his beak

He bathed his wings nervously in the mud
And said, heart full of the beautiful lake of his birth,
"Water, when will you rain? Lightning, when will you thunder?"
I see this sadness, strange and fatal myth

Toward the sky sometimes, like a character from Ovid
Toward the sky cruelly ironically blue
His head held up by his convulsive neck
As if addressing reproaches to God

II

Paris changes! But nothing in my melancholy
Has budged! New palaces, scaffoldings, blocks
Old suburbs, all for me becomes allegory
And my dear memories are heavier than rocks

Also in front of the Louvre an image oppresses me
I think of my great swan, with his mad gestures
Like the exiles, ridiculous and sublime
And gnawed at by a ceaseless desire! And then of you

Andromache, fallen from the arms of a great spouse,
Turned vile chattel, under the hand of superb Pyrrhus
Next to an empty tomb, bent in ecstasy
Widow of Hector, alas! And wife of Helenus.

I think of the black woman, scrawny and consumptive
Shuffling through the mud and searching with haggard eye
For absent coconut trees from magnificent Africa
Behind an immense wall of haze

For anyone who has lost that which cannot be retrieved
Never, never! To those who water the tears
And suckle Sadness like a good she-wolf
Of meagre orphans drying like flowers

Yet in the forest where my spirit is exiled
An old memory rings out like a blast from a horn
I think of sailors stranded on an isle
Of captives, of conquored ones, and others still
