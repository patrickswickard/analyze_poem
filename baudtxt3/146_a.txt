The Cat

I

In my mind there walks
As though it were his apartment
A beautiful cat, strong, soft and charming.
When he meows, he is barely heard

Much of his timbre is tender and discreet
But how his voice calms or scolds
It is always rich and profound
There is his charm and his secret

This voice, which pearls and filters
Into my darkest depths
Fills me like a great verse
And rejuvenates me like a potion

It puts to sleep the cruelest evils
And contains every ecstasy
To speak this very long sentence
It has no need for words

No, it is not the bow that bites
Upon my heart, perfect instrument
And it makes the most vibrant chord
Sing out more royally

It is your voice, mysterious
Cat, seraphic and strange,
You are just like an angel
So subtle and harmonious

II

From his fur blonde and brown
Comes a perfume so soft that one night
I found myself embalmed by it
For I touched it only once

It is the familiar spirit of this place
It judges, it presides and inspires
All the things in its empire
Perhaps it's a fae, or is it a god?

When my eyes are drawn toward the cat whom I love
Drawn as if to a magnet
It turns itself, docile,
And I look into myself

I gaze with atonement
Into the fire of its pale pupils
Clear beacons, living opals
Which stare at me in contemplation
