The Balcony

Mother of memories, mistress of mistresses
Oh you, all my pleasures!  Oh you, all my duty!
You remember the beauty of the caresses
The softness of the hearth and the charm of the evenings
Mother of memories, mistress of mistresses

The evenings lit by the heat of the coals
And the evenings on the balcony, veiled by a mist of rose
How soft was your breast! how good was your heart!
We often spoke of eternal things
The evenings lit by the heat of the coals

How fair are the sunsets in the warm evenings
How deep is the sky! How strong is the heart!
Leaning toward you, queen of what I adore,
I believe myself breathing the perfume of your blood
How fair are the sunsets in the warm evenings

Still the night thickened around us like a wall
And my eyes in the dark sensed your pupils
And I drank of your breath, Oh sweetness!  Oh poison!
And your feet relaxed in my brotherly hands
Still the night thickened around us like a wall

I still can recall those delightful moments
And remember myself embracing your knees
Why would I seek your languid beauties
Anywhere but in your lovely body, in your heart so soft?
I still can recall those delightful moments

Those pledges, those perfumes, those infinite kisses
Will they be reborn in a chasm forbidden to our probes
Climbing to the sky like the rejuvenated sun
After being washed at the bottom of the deep seas?
Oh pledges, oh perfumes, oh infinite kisses!
