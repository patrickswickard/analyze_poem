Duel

Two warriors ran on each other, one after the other,
Their weapons splashing the air with sparks and with blood
This game, these clashes of iron are the noise
Of youth in the grip of a wailing love

The blades are broken, like our youth,
My love! But the teeth and the sharpened claws
Soon avenge the epee and the treacherous dagger
O the fury of mature hearts through ulcerous love!

In the ravine haunted by wildcats and leopards
Our heros, cruelly grasping each other have rolled
And their skin will bring flowers to the arid brambles

This abyss, it is a hell populated by our friends
Let's roll there without remorse, inhuman Amazon,
To immortalize the ardor of our hatred!
