A Voyage to Cythera

My heart, like a bird, was flying joyously
And hovering freely around the ropes
The ship was rolling under a cloudless sky
Like an angel drunk on the rays of the sun

What island is this, sad and black? 'Tis Cythera,
We are told, a land famous in the songs
The banal Eldorado of all the old bachelors
Look, for all that it is a miserable place

Isle of soft secrets and festivals of the heart
Of antique Venus, that superb phantom
Above the seas hovering like an aroma
And full of spirits of love and langour

Beautiful isle of green myrtles, full of blooms
Venerated above all by every nation
Where the sighing of hearts in adoration
Rolls like incense on a garden of roses

Or the eternal cooing of a pigeon!
Cythera was nothing but a meager terrain
A desert of rocks troubled by shrill cries.
And yet I glimpsed a peculiar sight

It was not a temple in the shade of the woods
Or a young priestess, in love with the flowers
Walking, her body burning with hot secrets
Her robe blowing open with the passing breezes

But as we passed, hugging the shore
Close enough for our white sails to stir up the birds
We saw there a gibbet comprised of three branches
Silhouetted against the sky, like a cypress

The ferocious birds perched there upon their meal
Destroying with rage a hanged man, still ripe
Each planted its dirty beak like a tool
In each bloody corner of this rottenness

The eyes were two holes, and from the collapsed belly
The heavy intestines spilled down to his thighs
And these torturers, gorged on their hideous delights
With pecks of their beaks had fully castrated him

Under his feet a troop of jealous beasts on four legs
Their muzzles upraised, circled and prowled
A still greater beast nearby moved around
Much like an official surrounded by aides

Inhabitant of Cythera, child of the sky so fair,
You were suffering these insults in silence
In expiation for your infamous worship
And the sins which to you had forbidden the tomb

Ridiculous hanged one, your sorrows are my own!
I felt, upon seeing your dangling limbs
The long flowing river of ancient sorrows
Like vomit rising up toward my teeth

Before you, poor devil, whose memory is dear,
I felt all the beaks and all of the jaws
Of each pecking crow and black panther
Who in times past had torn at my flesh

The sky was charming, the sea was placid,
For me all was bloody and black from then on
Alas! I have buried, as if in a thick shroud,
My heart within this allegory

On your island, oh Venus, I have found nothing standing
But a symbolic gibbet from which hangs my image
Oh, Teacher! Give me the strength and the courage
To regard my body and heart sans disgust!
