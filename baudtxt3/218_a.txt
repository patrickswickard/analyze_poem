The Clock

Clock! Sinister god, fearful, impassive
Who menaces us with his finger and says to us "Remember!
The vibrant Sadness in your fearful heart
Will be soon be sown there like a target

Vaporous Pleasure will flee toward the horizon
Like a sylph at the end of a scene
Each instant devours a morsel of delight
Accorded to every man in his season

Thirty-six hundred times per hour, the Second
Whispers, 'Remember!' quickly, with the voice
Of an insect. Now says 'I am what was,
And I have sucked your life with my filthy trick!

Remember! Souviens-toi! Prodigal! Esto memor!
(My metal throat speaks every language.)
The minutes, frisky mortal, are the gangues,
Which can't be left without extracting the gold!

Remember that Time is an avid player
Who wins without cheating at every move! 'Tis the law.
The day decreases, the night grows longer; Remember!
The abyss is always thirsty; the water clock empties

Soon will toll the hour of divine Chance
When august Virtue, your still-virginal spouse,
When Repentance as well (oh the final shelter!),
When everything says to you Die, old coward! It is too late!"
