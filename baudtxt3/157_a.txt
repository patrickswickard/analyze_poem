The Cracked Bell

It is bittersweet, during the nights of winter
To listen, close to the fire that throbs and smokes
The faraway memories slowly lifting
At the noise of the carillons which sing through the fog

Happily the bell in gives off from its vigorous throat
Which, despite its age, alert and full of good omen
Faithfully emits its religious cry
Like an old soldier who stands watch under his tent

Me, my soul is cracked, and when in its boredom
It wants to fill the cold night air with its songs
It often finds its voice feeble and frail

Like the thick death rattle of a wounded man
Forgotten by a pool of blood, under a great pile of dead
And who dies, without moving, with great effort
