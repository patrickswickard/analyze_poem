The Cracked Bell

'Tis bittersweet, during the nights of winter, to listen to,
Close to the fire that throbs and smokes,
The faraway memories slowly lifting,
The noise of the carillons which sing through the fog

Happily the bell sounds off from its vigorous throat
Which, despite its age, alert and full of good omen
Faithfully emits its religious cry
Like an old soldier who stands watch under his tent

Me, my soul is cracked, and when in its boredom
It wants to fill the cold night air with its songs
It often finds its voice feeble and frail

Like the thick death rattle of a wounded man
Forgotten near a pool of blood, under a great pile of dead
And who dies, motionless, with great effort
