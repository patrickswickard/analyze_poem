To a Creole Woman

In a perfumed country caressed by the sun,
Under a canopy of purple trees
And palms that weep laziness into your eyes,
I knew a creole woman with charms undiscovered.

Her complexion was warm and pale, this dusky enchantress.
She had in her neck a noble manner;
Tall and svelte, she moved like a huntress
With a tranquil smile and confident eyes.

If you could come, Madame, to the land of true glory,
On the banks of the Seine or the green river Loire,
Beauty befitting of the antique manors,

You would in the shelter of those shadowed retreats
Make blossom a thousand sonnets in the hearts of poets,
Whom your large lovely eyes would make tame as your slaves.
