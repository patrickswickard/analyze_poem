The One Who Warns

Every man worthy of being called a man
Has in his heart a yellow serpent
Placed as if on a throne
Who, if he says "Do I want to?", responds "No!"

Dive your eyes into the staring eyes
Of Satyresses or of Nixes
This fang says, "Think of your duty!"

Raise the children, plant the trees,
Polish the verses, sculpt the marbles
The fang says, "Will you live this evening?"

Whatever he would plan or hope for
The man does not live a moment
Without suffering the warnings
Of this unbearable viper.
