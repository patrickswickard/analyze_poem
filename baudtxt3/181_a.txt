Damned Women

Like pensive cattle reclining in the sand,
They turn their eyes toward the sea's horizon,
Their feet seeking each other and their hands clasped together
They have the soft languor of bitter shivers.

Some, whose hearts love the long confessions,
In the depths of the thickets where chatter the streams,
Go spelling out the names of their shy childhood loves
Carving them into the green wood of shrubs;

Others, like sisters, walk slowly and gravely
Among the rocks full of apparitions,
Where holy Saint Anthony saw emerge like the lava
The breasts nude and purple of his temptations;

There are some in the light of the crumbling resin,
Who in the mute hollows of old pagan caverns
Call you for help with their feverish howling,
Oh Bacchus, sleeper of ancient remorses!

And others, whose breasts crave the feeling of scapulars,
Who, hiding a whip underneath their long vestments,
Mix in the dark wood and solitary nights,
The froth of pleasure with the tears of torments.

Oh virgins, oh demons, oh monsters, oh martyrs,
Oh great spirits contemptuous of reality,
Seekers of the infinite, devotees and satyrs,
Sometimes full of cries, sometimes full of tears,

You whom my spirit has followed into hell,
Poor sisters, I love you as much as I pity you,
For your sad mourning, your unslakable thirsts,
And the urns of love which fill your grand hearts.
