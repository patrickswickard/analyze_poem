Meditation

Be wise, oh my Sadness, and keep yourself more tranquil.
You demanded the Evening; It descends; here it is:
An atmosphere obscure envelopes the town,
Bringing to us peace, to others worry.

While mortals, that vile multitude under the whip,
Of Pleasure, this torturer without mercy,
Will gather remorse from the servile party,
My Sadness, take my hand: come through here,

Far from them. See the leaning of the years past,
On the balconies of the sky, in old-fashioned robes;
Emerging from the botom of the waters of smiling Regret;

The dying sun goes to sleep under an arch,
And, like a long shroud trailing to the east,
Hear, my dear, hear the soft night on the march.
