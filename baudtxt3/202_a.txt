Hymn to Beauty

Do you come from deep Heaven or leave the Abyss,
O Beauty? Your gaze, infernal and divine,
Flows confusingly with beneficence and with crime,
And for that you can be compared to wine.

You contain in your eye the dusk and the dawn;
You spread your perfumes like a stormy evening;
Your kisses are a potion and your mouth an amphora
Which makes the hero cower and the child courageous.

Do you leave the black abyss or descend from the stars?
Charmed Destiny follows your skirts like a dog;
You sow by chance both joy and disaster,
And you rule over all and answer to no one.

You walk on the dead, Beauty, whom you mock;
And your jewels of Horror are no less charming,
And Death, among your most precious charms,
Dances lovingly upon your proud chest.

The ephemeral takes flight toward you, candle,
Crackling, flaming, and says, Let us bless the flame!
The lover pants, leaning on his beloved
Like a dying man who caresses his tomb.

What matter whether you come from Heaven or Hell,
Oh Beauty! Enormous monster, frightening, ingenuous!
If your eye, your smile, your foot, for me open the door
Of an endlesslness I love and have never known?

What matter whether from Satan or God? Angel or Siren?
What matter, if you make, oh faerie with velvet eyes,
Rhythm, perfume, glittering, my only queen,
The universe less hideous and the moments less heavy?
