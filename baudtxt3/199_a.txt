The Death of Artists

How many times must I shake my bells
And kiss your low forehead, dreary caricature
To pierce the target of the mystique of nature
How many arrows must be lost, oh my quiver!

We use up our soul in subtle plots
And we demolish many a heavy frame
Before contemplating the great Creature
The infernal desire of whom fills us with sobs

THere are those who have never known their Idol
And these sculptors, damned and marked with affront
Who hammer themselves on the breast and the brow

Have only the hope, strange and somber Capitol,
That Death, hovering like a new sun
Will make flowers blossom out of their brains
