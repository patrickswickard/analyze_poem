Cloudy Sky

One would say that your regard was clouded with mist
Your mysterious eye (is it blue, grey, or green?)
Alternatively tender, dreamy, cruel
Reflects the indolence and pallor of the sky

You recall those white days, tedious and veiled
That made enchanted hearts melt into tears
When, shaken by an uknown evil that tortures them
The nerves too awakened taunt the spirit that sleeps

You remember sometimes the beautiful horizons
Where the suns lit the foggy seasons
Like you glimmer, beautiful countryside
Enflaming the rays that fall from a cloudy sky!

Oh dangerous woman, oh seductive climate!
Would I also adore the snow and the frost
Would I know how to pull from the implacable winter
The pleasures most sharp from the ice and the iron?
