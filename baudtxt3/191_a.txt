The Litanies of Satan

Oh you, the wisest and most beautiul of angels
Betrayed by God and deprived of praises

Oh Satan, take pity on my long misery!

Oh Prince in exile, who has been done wrong
And who, vanquished, always stands up stronger

Oh Satan, take pity on my long misery!

You who knows everything, great king of all things underground
Warrior familiar with human anguishes

Oh Satan, take pity on my long misery!

You who, even to lepers and cursed pariahs
Teaches through love the taste of paradise

Oh Satan, take pity on my long misery!

You who through Death, your old and strong beloved
Engendered Hope, a charming madwoman

Oh Satan, take pity on my long misery!

You who gives the proscribed a calm and high attitude
Who damns the entire mob around a scaffold

Oh Satan, take pity on my long misery!

You who knows in every corner of envious earth
Where jealous God hid the precious stones

Oh Satan, take pity on my long misery!

You whose clear eye knows the deep arsenals
In which are buried veins of metal

Oh Satan, take pity on my long misery!

You whose huge hand hides the precipices
From wandering sleepwalkers next to the edifices

Oh Satan, take pity on my long misery!

You who magically softens the old bones
Of the slow drunkard tread upon by horses

Oh Satan, take pity on my long misery!

You who, to console the frail man who suffers
Taught us to mix saltpeter and sulfur

Oh Satan, take pity on my long misery!

You who puts your mark, oh subtle accomplice
On the forehead of Croesus, vile and unpitiable

Oh Satan, take pity on my long misery!

You who put in the eyes and the heart of whores
The cult of open sores and the love of rags

Oh Satan, take pity on my long misery!

Staff of exiles, lamp of inventors,
Confessor of the hanged and of conspirators

Oh Satan, take pity on my long misery!

Adoptive father of those with a black anger
Chased from Paradise to earth by God the Father

Oh Satan, take pity on my long misery!

Prayer

Glory and praise to you, Satan, upon high
From heaven, where you reigned, and in the depths
Of Hell, where, vanquished, you dream in silence!
Put my soul one day under the Tree of Knowledge
Near you in repose at the hour when over your forehead
Its branches will spread like a new Temple!
