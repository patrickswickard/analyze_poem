The Monster

I

You are certainly not, my dearest,
That which Veuillot calls a tendron.
The game, the love, the good food,
Boils in you, old pot,
You are no longer fresh, my dearest,

My old infant! However
Your senseless caravans
Which gave you abundant luster
Of things that were much used,
But which seduced anyway.

I do not find boring
The green of your forty years;
I prefer your fruits, Autumn,
To the banal flowers of Spring!
No! You are never boring!

Your carcass has its good points
And particular graces;
I find strange peppers
In the hollows of your two shoulder blades;
Your carcass has its good points!

To hell with those ridiculous lovers
Of melon and pumpkin!
I prefer your bony shoulders
To those of King Solomon,
And I find that lot ridiculous!

Your hair, like a blue helmet,
Shades your brow like a warrior,
Who thinks not and blueshes a bit,
And then flees for the rear,
Like the mane of a blue helmet!

Your eyes are like the mud,
Where a lighthouse shines,
Reviving the rose in your cheek,
Shining an infernal light!
Your eyes are black like the mud!

Through your luxury and your disdain
Your bitter lip provokes us;
This lip, it is an Eden
Which draws us and which shocks us.
What luxury! And what disdain!

Your leg muscular and dry
Could climb atop the volcanoes,
And despite the snow and the drift
Dance the most fiery can-cans.
Your leg is muscular and dry;

Your skin, burning and without softness,
Like that of an old policeman,
No more knows the sweat
Like your eye does not know tears.
(And yet it has its softness!)

II

Fool, going straight to the devil!
I would willingly go with you,
If your frightfully speedy pace
Did not cause me such motion sickness.
Go then, alone, to the devil!

My kidney, my lung, my leg
Will not let me bow and render homage
To this Lord, as should be done.
"Alas, it is really too bad!"
Say my kidney and my leg.

Oh, very sincerely I suffer
To not go out on sabbaths,
To see, when he passes sulfur-scented wind,
How you kiss his ass!
Oh, very sincerely I suffer!

I am devilishly afflicted
To not be your torch,
And to ask you to leave,
Flame of hell! Judge my dear,
How much I am afflicted,

For a long time I have loved you,
Being very logical! In effect,
Wanting to search the cream of evil
And loving nothing but a perfect monster,
Truly yes! Old monster, I love you!
