Spleen

I am like the king of a rainy country
Rich but powerless, young and yet very old
Who, scorning the bows of his tutors
Gets bored with the dogs as with the other beasts
Nothing can make him gay, not game nor falcon,
Not his people dying in front of his balcony
Nor the favorite jester with the grotesque ballad
The wise one who No longer distracts his brow from this cruel malade
His bed bedecked with fleur-de-lis transformed to a tomb
And the women around, for whom any prince will do
No longer can find a cheeky toilette
To draw forth a smile from this young skeleton
The alchemist making his gold was never able
To extract from his being the corrupt element
And in those bloodbaths the Romans came to
And which in their old age the powerful remember
He knew not how to reheat his dazed cadaver
Which instead of blood flows with the green waters of Lethe
