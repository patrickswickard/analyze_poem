The End of the Day

Under a sickly pale light
Life dances and senselessly writhes
Impudent and garish.
Until on the horizon

Voluptuous night rises,
Easing everything, even, hunger
Erasing everything, even shame,
The Poet says: "Finally!

My spirit, like my spine,
Ardently calls for rest;
My heart full of funeral songs,

I will lie down on my back
And wrap myself in your curtains,
O refreshing darkness!"
