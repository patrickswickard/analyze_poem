The Soul of Wine

One evening, the soul of wine sang from the bottles
"Man, I plead to you, o dear disinherited one
Inside my prison of glass and vermillion wax
A song full of light and brotherhood

I know how much it took, on the scorching hillside
Suffering, sweating and cooking in the sun
To bring me life and give me a soul
But I would be neither ingrateful or malicious

Since I feel an immense joy when I tumble
Down the throat of a man exhausted from his work
And his warm belly is a soft tomb
Where I would rather be than my cool cellars

Do you hear ring out the Sunday refrains
And the hope that bubbles in my beating heart
Elbows on the table and sleeves rolled up
You will glorify me and be content

I will light the eyes of your eager woman
And your son I will give his strength and color
And be for the frail athlete of life
The oil that firms up the muscle of wrestlers

Inside you I spill, vegetal ambrosia
Precious grain thrown by the eternal Sower
So that our love gives birth to poetry
Which springs forth to God like a rare flower
