Elevation

Above the ponds, above the valleys,
The mountains, the woods, the clouds, the seas,
Beyond the sun, beyond the ether,
Beyond the confines of starry spheres,

My spirit, you move with grace,
And like a good swimmer who swoons in the water,
You plough gaily through the deep immensity
With an indescribable and masculine virility.

Fly far from these morbid miasmas;
Purify yourself in the better air,
And drink, like a pure liqueur,
The clear fire that fills limpid space.

Behind the boredom and the great sadness
That burden cloudy existence with their weight,
Happy is he who can soar with a vigorous wing
To the serene and luminous fields;

Whose thoughts, like the skylarks,
Rise to the morning skies in free flight;
Who glides on life and understands effortlessly
The language of flowers and silent things!
