The Joyful Death

In a rich earth filled with snails
I want to dig myself a deep grave
Where I can at leisure spread out my old bones
And sleep in the oblivion like a shark in the waves

I hate the testaments and I hate the tombs
Rather than beg a tear from the world
Living, I would like to invite the crows
To bleed every corner of my filthy carcass

Oh worms! Black companions without eyes and ears
Come see for you a death free and joyful
Living philosophers, sons of rottenness

Go toward my ruin therefore without remorse
And tell me if it is still such torture
For this old soulless body and dead among the dead!
