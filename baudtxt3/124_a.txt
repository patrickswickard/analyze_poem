With her dresses pearly and flowing

With her dresses pearly and flowing,
Even as she walks we believe that she dances
Like those long snakes that the sacred jugglers
Stir up in cadence at the ends of their sticks.

Like the gloomy sand and the blue of the deserts,
Both insensible to human suffering
Like the long network of waves in the ocean,
She unfolds herself indifferently.

Her polished eyes are made of charming stone,
And within this nature strange and symbolic
Where the untarnished angel blends with the antique sphinx,

Where there is nothing but gold, steel, light, and diamonds,
There shines forever, like a useless star,
The majestic coldness of a sterile woman.
