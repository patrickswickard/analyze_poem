The Cat

Come, my beautiful cat, on my amorous heart
Keep your claws inside your paws
And let me dive into your beautiful eyes
Mixed with metal and agate

While my fingers leisurely caress
Your head and your elastic back
And how my hand fills with pleasure
To touch your electric body

I see my woman in spirit.  Her look
Like yours, lovably dumb
Deep and cold, cuts and severs like a dart

And, from her head to her feet
A subtle air, a dangerous perfume
Swims around her brown body.
