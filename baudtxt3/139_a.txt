Reversibility

Angel full of gaiety, do you know the anguish
The shame, the remorse, the sobbing, the boredoms
And the vague terrors of those frightful nights
Which press the heart like a paper is crumpled?
Angel full of gaiety, do you know the anguish?

Angel full of bounty, do you know the hatred
The shaking fists in the shadow and the tears of the faithful
When Vengeance beats his infernal call
And is the captain of our faculties?
Angel full of bounty, do you know the hatred?

Angel full of health, do you know Fever
Which, along the great walls of the pallid hospice
Goes forth like an exile with a straggling foot
Seeking the rare sun and twitching its lips?
Angel full of health, do you know Fever?

Angel full of beauty, do you know wrinkles
And the fear of growing old, and this hideous torment
Of reading the secret horror of devotion
Changed from passion in the eyes of one once enamored
Angel full of beauty, do you know wrinkles?

Angel full of happiness, of joy and lights,
Dying David would have asked for health
From emanations from your enchanted body
But of you, angel, I ask only prayers
Angel full of happiness, of joy and lights
