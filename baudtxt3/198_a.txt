The Death of the Poor

It is the death that consoles, alas, and which makes live
It is the goal of life and the only hope
Which, like an elixir, shows us and makes us drunk
And gives us the heart to go on until evening

Toward the storm and the snow and the frost
It is the vibrant clarity on our black horizon
It is the famous inn inscribed on the book
Where one can eat and sleep and sit

It is an Angel who holds in his magnetic grip
The sleep and the gift of ecstatic dreams
And which makes the bed of the people poor and naked

It is the glory of God, it is the mystical granary
It is the purse of the pauper and his antique homeland
It is the portico open to the unknown Heavens
