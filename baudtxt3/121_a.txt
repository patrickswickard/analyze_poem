I adore you as much as the nocturnal vault

I adore you as much as the nocturnal vault,
Oh vase of sadness, oh great quiet one,
And I love you still more, beauty, because you flee me,
And since you seem, ornament of my nights,
Ironically to increase the number of leagues
That separate my arms from the infinite blue.

I advance to attack, and I climb to assault,
Like a choir of worms upon a cadaver,
And I cherish, Oh cruel implacable beast,
All this coldness which makes you more beautiful to me!
