The Venal Muse

Oh muse of my heart, who loves palaces,
When January unleashes its north winds, will you have
During the black boredom of snowy evenings
A firebrand to warm your violet feet?

Will you revitalize your marbled shoulders
With the nocturnal rays that pierce the shutters?
Feeling your purse, empty and dry as your mouth,
Will you harvest the gold of azure vaults

You'll need, to earn your bread every evening,
To swing the censer like a child in the choir,
Singing the Te Deum in which you hardly still believe

Oh, hungry clown, spread your appeal
And your laughter soaked with unseen tears
To stoke amusement from the vulgar crowd
