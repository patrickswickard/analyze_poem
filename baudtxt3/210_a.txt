Song of the Afternoon

Your eyebrows so unkind
Give you an odd air
Which is not that of an angel,
Sorceress with enticing eyes,

I love you, oh my vain one,
My terrible passion!
With all the devotion
Of a priest for his idol.

The desert and the forest
Perfume your rough tresses,
Your head assumes the poses
Of the enigma and its answer.

On your skin the perfume lingers
As it does around a censer;
You charm like the evening
A nymph, dark and warm.

Ah! The strongest potion
Is no peer of your langour,
And you know the caress
Which could revive the dead!

Your hips are in love
With your back and your breasts,
And you ravish the cushions
With your langorous poses.

Sometimes to appease
Your mysterious fury,
You indulge yourself, seriously,
With bites and with kisses;

You tear into me, my brown one,
With a mocking laugh,
Then you gaze on my heart,
Your eye soft as the moon.

Beneath your slippers of satin,
Beneath your charming silky feet
I take such great pleasure,
My genie and my destiny,

My soul is healed through you,
Through you, light and color!
An explosion of warmth
In my dark Siberia!
