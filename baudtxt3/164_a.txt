To a red-haired beggar girl

Pale girl with auburn hair
Through the holes in your dress
One can see your poverty
And your beauty

For me, a scrawny poet,
Your young malnourished body
Full of freckles
Seems soft and sweet

You wear your heavy shoes
More gallantly
Than a queen from a novel
Wears her velvet slippers

In place of rags too short
You should have a courtly robe
With long rustling folds
Trailing at your heels

Instead of holey stockings
There should be at your thigh
For leering lechers' eyes
A glimmering dagger of gold

Poorly tied knots
Would unveil for our sins
Your two beautiful breasts
Radiant as your eyes

Your arms would beg
For you to be undressed
And chase away with coquettish blows
Mischievous fingers

Pearls of the most beautiful water
Sonnets of the master Belleau
Would be offered ceaselessly
By the suitors you've locked in chains

Lousy little poets
Dedicating to you their first fruits
And contemplating your slipper
Under the stairway

Many a page burns by chance
Many a lord and many a Ronsard
To spy in order to find
Your latest hideaway

You would count in your bed
More kisses than there are lilies
And tame under your law
More than one Valois

Nevertheless you go begging
For any old scraps laying around
At the door of any VÃ©four
At the crossroads

You go looking down
Seeking cheap baubles for 29 sous
Which - Oh I'm sorry,
Can't be given to you

Go therefore, unadorned,
Without perfume, pearls, or diamonds
With your meager nudity
Oh my beauty!
