To a Woman Passing By

The deafening street around me howled
Long, narrow and mournful, majestic and sad
A woman passed, with her splendid hand
Lifting and swinging the hem of her skirts

Agile and noble, her leg statuesque
Me, I drank it in, tense and awkward
In her eye, a blue sky wherein formed a storm
The enchanting softness, the pleasure that kills

A flash...then the night!  Fleeting beauty
Whose sight made me suddenly reborn
Shall I gaze on you no more for an eternity?

Elsewhere far from here!  Too late!  Never perhaps!
As I know not where you flee, you know not where I go
Oh you whom I could have loved!  Oh you who knew it!
