The Wine of the Solitary

The peculiar regard of a gallant woman
Who glides toward us like a pale ray of light
Sent by the shimmering moon to the trembling lake,
When she wants to bathe her nonchalant beauty;

The last sack of coins in the grip of a gambler;
A libertine kiss from the slim Adeline;
The sounds of a tune, grating and saccharine,
Like the faraway cry of human sadness,

All this is not worth, oh deep bottle,
The penetrating balms that your fertile belly
Watches at the altered heart of the pious poet;

You pour him hope, youth and life,
And pride, this treasure for all of the wretched,
Which renders us triumphant and comparable to Gods!
