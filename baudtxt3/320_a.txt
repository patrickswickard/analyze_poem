The Complaints of an Icarus

The lovers of prostitutes
Are happy, cheerful and satisfied;
As for me, my arms are exhausted
For having embraced the clouds.

'Tis thanks to the unequalled stars,
That blaze at the base of the sky,
That my exhausted eyes only see
The memories of suns.

In vain I had wanted
To find the end of space;
I know not under which eye of fire
I feel my wing breaking;

And burned by the love of beauty,
I will not have the sublime honor
To give my name to the abyss
Which will serve as my tomb.
