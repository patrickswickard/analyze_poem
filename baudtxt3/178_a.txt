A Martyr

Sketch by an unknown master

In the midst of flasks, of lam√© fabrics,
And of luxurious furniture
Of marbles, of tables, of perfumed dresses
That trail in sumptuous folds

In a room lukewarm like a greenhouse
The air is dangerous and fatal
Where the dying bouquets in their coffins of glass
Exhale their final sighs

A headless cadaver pours out, like a river,
Upon a saturated pillow
Its blood red and lively, which the cloth drinks in
With the avidity of a dry prairie

Like pale visions which give birth to a shadow
And which capture the eye
The head, with the mass of its somber mane
And with its precious jewels

Sits on the night table like a buttercup
And, empty of thoughts
A look vague and pale like the twilight
Escapes its contorted eyes

On the bed, the nude body, spread out shamelessly
With the most complete abandon
The secret splendor and the fatal beauty
Which nature had given it

A pink stocking, ornamented with gold,
On the leg like a souvenir
The garter, like a secret eye that burns
Darting with a diamond gaze

The peculiar aspect of this solitude
And the great langourous portrait
Eyes as provocative as the pose
Reveal a dark morbid love

Guilty pleasure and strange parties
Full of infernal kisses
In which the swarm of evil angels rejoice
Swimming in the folds of the curtains

And despite that, to see the elegant slimness
Of the shoulder with its awkward form
The hip a bit pointed, and taut at the waist
Like an agitated reptile

She is still quite young! Her soul exasperated
And her senses bitten by boredom
Had they opened themselves to the hungry mob
Of lost and wandering desires?

The vindictive man whom you couldn't when living
Sooth, despite your love
Did he quench on your flesh, inert and complacent
The immensity of his desire?

Respond, impure cadaver! And through your stiff tresses
Raise up a feverish arm
Tell me, frightful head, upon your cold teeth
Did he plant a farewell kiss?

Far from the mocking world, far from the impure crowd
Far from curious magistrates
Sleep in peace, sleep in peace, strange creature,
In your mysterious tomb

Your spouse walks the world, and your immortal form
Watches him when he sleeps
Without a doubt he'll be faithful to you
Until his dying day
