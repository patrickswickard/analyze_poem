To the reader

Stupidity, error, sin, and stinginess
Occupy our spirits and work our bodies,
And we feed our amiable remorses
Like beggars nourish their vermin.

Our sins are stubborn, our repentances loose,
We make ourselves pay dearly with our confessions,
And then we go gaily back to the mire,
Believing the vile tears wash away the stains.

On the pillow of evil is Satan Trismegistus
Who cradles for ages our enchanted spirit,
And the rich metal of our will
Is vaporized by this skilled alchemist.

It is the devil who holds our puppet strings!
We find ourselves lured by repugnant things;
We descend one more step every day toward Hell,
Without horror, through the stinking shadows.

Like one poor and debauched who kisses and sucks
The martyred breast of an old prostitute,
We steal in passing a secret pleasure
And squeeze out its juices like a stale old orange.

Tight and teeming, like a million maggots,
Inside our brains churn a brood of demons,
And when we breathe, Death descends in our lungs,
A river unseen, with muffled cries

If violence, poison, the dagger, the inferno
Still haven't embroidered their pleasant sketches
On the banal canvas of of our pitiful lives,
Alas! It's because our souls aren't bold enough.

But among the jackals, the panthers, the lice,
The monkeys, the scorpions, the vultures, the snakes,
The monsters yelping, howling, creeping, growling,
In the infamous menagerie of our vices

There is one more ugly, more mean, more unclean!
Though he cannot be moved with great deeds or great cries,
He would gladly turn the Earth to debris
And swallow the world with a yawn;

It is Boredom!  His eye wet with an involuntary tear,
He dreams of a scaffold while lighting his hookah.
You know, reader, this delicate monster,
Hypocrite reader, my likeness--my brother!
