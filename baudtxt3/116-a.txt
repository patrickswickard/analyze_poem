Beauty

I am beautiful, oh mortal, like a dream carved from stone
And my breast, where everyone is bruised one after another,
Is made for inspiring in poets a love
Eternal and silent like matter

I'm enthroned in the blue like an enigmatic sphinx
I unite in one heart the whitness of swans and snow
I hate movement, which displaces lines
So I never cry and I never laugh

The poets, before my grand attitudes,
Which I seem to borrow from the proudest monuments,
Consume their days in austere study

Since I have, to enchant my docile lovers,
Pure mirrors which make everything more beautiful:
My eyes, my great eyes with their eternal brilliance!
