Carrion

Remember the object that we saw, my love,
That beautiful summer morning so soft:
At the bend of a path a vile corpse
On a bed of pebbled gravel.

The legs in the air like a lustful woman,
Burning and sweating poisons,
Open in a nonchalant cynical way
Its stomach bloated with exhalations.

The sun shone on its putridness,
As if to cook it to perfection,
And to give back to Nature a hundredfold
That which it had assembled;

And the sky regarded this superb carcasse
Like a blooming flower.
The stench was so strong you thought you would
Faint upon the grass.

The flies buzzed on its putrid gut,
From which oozed a black battalion
Of larvae, which flowed like thick liquid
Along these living rags.

All that descended and rose like a wave
Or poured out bubbling;
One could have said the corpse, swelling with vague breath,
Was living by multiplication.

And this world made a strange music,
Like the wind or running water,
Or the grain when a winnower rhythmically turns
And shakes the grain in her basket.

The forms were erased and were nought but a dream,
A sketch that slowly comes
To a forgotten canvas which the artist completes
By memory alone.

Behind the rocks a nervous dog
Regarded us angrily
Watching for the moment to seize from the bones
The morsel from which she was chased

You too will be like this filth,
Like this horrible infection,
Star of my eyes, sun of my nature,
You, my angel and my passion!

Yes! Such will you be, queen of the Graces,
After the last sacraments,
When your body moulders among the bones,
Beneath the grass and fattened flowers.

Therefore, my beauty, say to the vermin
Who will eat the kisses from you,
That I've kept the form and the essence divine
Of my decomposed love!
