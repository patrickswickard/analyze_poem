Carrion

Remember the object that we saw, my love
That beautiful summer morning so soft
At the bend of a path a vile corpse
On a bed of pebbled gravel

The legs in the air like a lustful woman
Burning and sweating poisons 
Open in a nonchalant cynical way
Its stomach bloated with exhalations

The sun shone on its putridness
As if to cook it to perfection
And to give back to Nature a hundredfold
That which it had assembled

And the sky regarded this superb carcasse
Like a blooming flower
The stench was so strong you thought you would
Faint upon the grass

The flies buzzed on its putrid gut
From which oozed a black battalion
Of larvae, which flowed like thick liquid
Along these living rags

All descended and rose like a wave
Which swelled up bubbling
As if it swelled with waves of breath
Living by multiplication

And this world made a strange music
Like the wind or running water
Or the grain when a winnower rhythmically turns
And shakes the grain in her basket

The forms were erased and were no longer but
A sketch that slowly comes
On an artist's forgotten canvas
That's completed by memory alone

Behind the rocks a nervous dog
Who watches us angrily
Watching for the moment when she can seize from the bones
The morsel from which she was chased

You too will be like this filth, queen of the Graces
After the last sacraments
When your body moulders among the bones
Beneath the grass and fattened flowers

Therefore, my beauty, say to the vermin
Who will eat the kisses from you
That I've kept the form and the essence divine
Of my decomposed love!
