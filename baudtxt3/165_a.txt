The Game

In the faded armchairs of old courtesans
Pale, eyelids painted, eyes alluring and deadly,
Simpering, and from the lobes of their thin ears
Comes the clanking of stone and metal

Around the red carpets of lipless faces
The lips without color, the jaws without teeth,
And the fingers convulse from an infernal fever
Searching the empty pocket or the beating breast

Under the dirty ceilings a row of pale lusters
And the enormous lamps project their glows
On the dark foreheads of illustrious poets
Who come to waste their sweat and their blood

There is the black table of a nocturnal dream
I saw unfold under my clairvoyant eye
Myself, in a corner of the taciturn den
I see myself leaning, cold, silent, envious

Envious of these people of tenacious passion
These old whores and their morbid gaiety
And all gaily trading before me
One ancient honor, another her beauty

And my heart feared to envy many a poor man
Dashing fervently toward the gaping abyss
And who, drunk with his blood, would at last prefer
The sadness of death and the hell of the void
