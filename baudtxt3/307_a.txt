Sad Madrigal

I

What matter is it to me if you are wise?
Be beautiful! And be sad! The tears
Add a charm to the face
Like a river to a landscape
The storm rejuvenates the flowers

I love you especially when the joy
Flees from your conquered brow
When your heart drowns in horror
When the awful cloud of the Past
Spreads itself over your Present

I love you when your big eyes pour
Their tears as hot as blood
When, despite my hand which rocks you
Your anguish, too heavy, pierces
Like the death rattle of one dying

I inhale, divine delight!
Deep hymn, delicious!
All the sobs from your chest
And believe that your heart is lighted
By the pearls that flow from your eyes

II

I know that your heart that abounds
With old uprooted loves
Still flames like a forge
And still smoldering in your chest
Is a bit of the pride of the damned

But so long, my dear, as your dreams
Will not have reflected Hell
And a relentless nightmare
Dreaming of poisons and swords
In love with powder and iron

Fearfully closed off to all
Deciphering evil everywhere
Convulsing when the hour strikes
You will not have felt the embrace
Of irresistible Disgust

You will not be able, queen and slave
Who only loves me with fear
In the horror of the unhealthy night
To say to me, soul full of cries
"I am your equal, Oh my King!"
