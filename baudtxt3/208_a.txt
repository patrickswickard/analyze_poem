Song of Autumn

I

Soon we will dive into the cold darkness;
Farewell, lively light of our summers too short!
I already hear with a morbid shock
The falling wood echoing on the paving stones of the yard.

All winter will return to my being: anger,
Hate, shivering, horror, toil hard and forced,
And, like the sun in his polar hell,
My heart will be nothing but a block blue and icy.

Trembling I listen to each falling log;
The scaffold being built has no echo more dull.
My spirit is like a tower that succumbs
To the blows of a battering ram, tireless and heavy.

It seems to me, rocked by this monotone shock,
That somewhere a coffin is being nailed in great haste.
For whom? Yesterday was summer; here is autumn!
This mysterious noise sounds like a departure.

I love the greenish light of your long eyes,
Soft beauty, but today everything is bitter to me,
And nothing, not your love nor your bed nor the hearth,
To me equals the worth of the sun shining on the sea.

And yet love me, tender heart! Be mother,
Even for an ingrate, even for a scoundrel;
Beloved or sister, be the ephemeral softness
Of a glorious autumn or a setting sun.

A short task! The tomb awaits, it is greedy!
Allow me with my brow bowing low at your knees,
While mourning the torrid white summer,
To taste the soft yellow rays of late autumn!
