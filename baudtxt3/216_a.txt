Alchemy of Sadness

One lights you up with an ardor,
The other makes you mourn, Nature!
What says to one: Sepulture
Says to another, Life and Splendor

Hermes unknown, who assists me
And who always intimidates me
You make me the equal of Midas
The saddest of the alchemists

Through you I change gold into iron
And Paradise into Hell
In the shroud of the clouds

I discover a cadaver dear
And on the banks celestial
Construct there great sarcophagi
