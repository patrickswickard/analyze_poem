Sisina

Imagine Diana in gallant array,
Traveling through the forests or beating the thickets,
Hair and bosom in the wind, drunk on the noise,
Superb, defying the best horsemen!

Have you seen Th√©roigne, lover of carnage,
Cheering on the assault by people without shoes,
The cheek and the eye of fire, playing her role,
And mounting, saber in hand, the royal stairs?

Such is Sisina! But the soft warrior woman
Has a soul charitable as it is murderous;
Her courage, stirred by the powder and drums,

Before the supplians knows how to lower her ams,
And her heart, ravaged by the flame, has always,
For one who is worthy a reservoir of tears.
