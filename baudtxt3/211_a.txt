Sisina

Imagine Diana in gallant array
Traveling through the forests or beating the thickets
Hair and bosom in the wind, drunk on the noise
Superb, defying the best horsemen

Have you seen Th√©roigne, lover of carnage
Excited at the assault of people without shoes
The cheek and the eye of fire, playing her role
And mounting, saber in hand, the royal stairs?

Such is Sisina! But the soft warrior
With a charitable soul as much as a murder
Her courage, stirred by the powder and drums

Before the supplians knows how to lower her ams,
And her heart, ravaged by the flame, has always
For one who is worthy a reservoir of tears
