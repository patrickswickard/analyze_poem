Confession

One time, only once, soft and lovable woman,
You pressed your smooth arm against mine
(Within the depths of my soul
This memory does not fade);

It was late and like a new medallion
The full moon swelled,
And the solemnity of the night, like a river,
Streamed through sleeping Paris.

And along the houses, under the porticos,
The cats passed furtively,
Their ears alert, and like dear shadows,
Slowly accompanied us.

Suddenly, in the midst of this intimate freedom
Was born from your pale clarity,
From you, rich and sonorous instrument
That only vibrates with gay radiance,

From you, clear and joyous as a fanfare
In the glittering morning,
A plaintive note, a note bizarre
Escaped, uneasily

Like a child, scrawny, horrible, somber, vile
Who makes the family blush,
And who has been kept hidden from the world
For a long time in a cellar, a shameful secret.

Poor angel, she sang, with a shrill sound:
"Nothing down here is certain,
And always with such care it is concealed,
This betrayal of human selfishness;

It is hard to be a beautiful woman,
And it is a banal job
For the dancer mad and cold who swoons
With a mechanical smile;

To build upon hearts is a stupid thing;
Everything crumbles, love and beauty,
Until Oblivion throws it in its basket
To return them to Eternity!"

I have often evoked that enchanted moon,
This silence and this langour,
And this confidence horribly whispered
A confession from the heart.
