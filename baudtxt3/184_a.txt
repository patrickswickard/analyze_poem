Allegory

She's a beautiful woman with luxurious shoulders,
Who lets her long hair drag through her wine.
The claws of love, the poisons of the brothel,
All slide off or are blunted on her granite skin.
She laughs at Death and taunts Debauchery,
These monsters with hands that scratch and reap,
Nonetheless respect in her destructive games
Her firm body and the grace of her rude majesty.
She walks like a goddess and lies down like a sultan;
And has in pleasure a faith Mohammedan,
And in her open arms which are full of her breasts,
She calls to the eyes of the whole human race.
She believes, she knows, this infertile virgin
And it is necessary in the march of the world,
That a beautiful body is a gift sublime
Which for any misdeed can uproot a pardon.
She ignores Hell as well as Purgatory,
And when the hour of black night is at hand
She will look upon the face of Death,
Like a newborn--without hatred, without remorse.
