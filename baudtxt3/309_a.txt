To a Malabar Woman

Your feet are as fine as your hands, your hips wide
The envy of the prettiest caucasian girls;
To the pensive artist your body is soft and dear;
Your big velvet eyes are more dark than your skin.
In the land hot and blue where your God crafted you,
Your task is to light your Master's pipe,
Keeping the flasks filled with fresh scented water,
To chase far from his bed any lurking mosquitos,
And as soon as dawn breaks and makes the trees sing,

To buy at the market pineapples and bananas.
Every day you go barefoot wherever you can,
And hum all the old unknown songs;
And when night descends with its scarlet cloak,
You lay yourself softly down onto a mat,
Where your floating dreams are full of hummingbirds,
And, like yourself, they are graceful and flowery.

Why, happy child, do you want to see France,
This our land, overcrowded, where misery is reaped,
To leave cozy life in the arms of the sea,
Saying farewell to your dear tamarinds?
You, clothed in such flimsy muslin,
Shivering under the snow and the hail,
How you would lament your lost leisures, soft and free
If, with a brutal corset imprisoning your flanks
You would have to glean your supper from our filth
And sell the perfume of your exotic charm,
Your eye pensive, and searching, through our dirty fog,
For the sparse scattered phantoms of coconut trees!
