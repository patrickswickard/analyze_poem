Beatrice

In the ashy burned lands without vegetation
I was complaining one day to nature
And as I was thinking, wandering aimlessly,
I slowly sharpened the dagger on my heart
I saw at noon coming down on my head
A funeral cloud, large and stormy,
Which carried a troupe of vicious demons
Which looked like cruel and curious dwarves
Considering me coldly as they crept
And like passers-by regarding a madman
I heard them laughing and whispering between them
Exchanging many a sign and many a wink

"Let's take a leisurely look at this caricature,
This shadow of Hamlet, imitating his posture
His indecisiveness, his hair blowing in the wind
Is it not a great pity to see this bon vivant
This beggar, this out of work actor, this rascal,
Since he knows how to artfully play his role
Wanting to interest in the song of his sadness
THe eagles and crickets, the streams and the flowers
And even us, authors of these stale scripts,
Reciting and howling his public tirades?"

I could have simply turned my regal head
(My pride as high as the mountains
Eclipsed the cloud and the cry of the demons)
If I had not seen among their obscene ranks
A crime which failed to drive the sun off course
The queen of my heart of unpeered regard
Who laughed with them at my somber distresses
And gave them at times some vile caresses
