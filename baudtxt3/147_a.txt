The Beautiful Boat

I want to tell you, o soft enchantress
Of the different beauties which adorn your youth
I want to paint your beauty
Where childhood is complemented by maturity

When you swing your long skirt through the air
You make the vision of a fair vessel
On the open sea, loaded with cloth, rolling along,
Following a soft rhythm, lazy and slow

Your neck long and round, atop your plump shoulders
Your head dancing with exotic graces
With a placid and triumphant air
You go along your way, majestic child

I want to tell you, o soft enchantress
Of the different beauties which adorn your youth
I want to paint your beauty
Where childhood is complemented by maturity

Your budding bosom which pushes the fabric,
Your triumphant bosom is a beautiful wardrobe
In which the panels, bulging and clear,
Are like shields reflecting the lightning

Provocative shields, armed with pink tips!
Wardrobe of soft secrets, full of great things
Of wine, of perfume, of liqueurs
Which make head and heart delirious

When you swing your long skirt through the air
You make the vision of a fair vessel
On the open sea, loaded with cloth, rolling along,
Following a soft rhythm, lazy and slow

Your noble thighs, chasing your swinging skirts
Torment and inflame the desires obscure
Like two sorceresses who stir
A black potion in a deep cauldron

Your arms, which could tease precocious Hercules
Are the every bit like glistening boas
As if made for squeezing stubbornly
And pressing your lover against your heart

Your neck long and round, atop your plump shoulders
Your head dancing with exotic graces
With a placid and triumphant air
You go along your way, majestic child
