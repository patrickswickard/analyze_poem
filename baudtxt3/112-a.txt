Gypsies Traveling

The prophetic tribe with ardent eyes
Yesterday set out, their young carried on their backs
Or yielding to those fierce appetites
The constant treasure of pendulous breasts

The men went on foot with their shining arms
Along the wagons where their families were huddled
Their heavy eyes mournfully tracing the skies
Bewailing the absence of fantastic beasts

From the bottom of his sandy redoubt as they pass
The cricket observes them, redoubling his song
Cybele, who loves them, makes greenery spring forth

She colors the rocks and flowers the desert
In front of the travelers, opening for them
The familiar realm of shady futures
