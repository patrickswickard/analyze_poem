One Night When I Slept with a Frightful Jew

One night when I slept with a frightful Jew,
Like a corpse laid out beside a corpse,
Next to this whore I began to dream
Of the sad beauty of whom my desire was deprived.

I would represent her native majesty,
Her gaze endowed with vigor and with grace,
Her hair she made into a perfumed helm,
The memory of which revived my love.

For I'd have fervently kissed your noble body,
From your cool feet to your tresses black
Unleashed the treasure of your deep caresses,

If, some evening, with an effortless tear,
You would only, oh queen of cruel women,
Obscure the splendor of your chilly eyes.
