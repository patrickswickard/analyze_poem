Semper Eadem

"Where do you come from, tell me, this strange sadness
Rising like the sea against a bare black rock?"
Once our heart has harvested its vintage,
Living is an evil. It is a secret known to all.

A very simple sadness, not mysterious
And, like your joy, dazzling for all.
Cease then searching, oh curious beauty!
And, hush, even if your voice is soft!

Hush, ignorant girl! Always eager soul!
Laughing childish mouth! still more than Life,
Death often binds us with its subtle chains

Oh let my heart be drunken with a lie
Let it dive into your gorgeous eyes like a beautiful dream
And sleep for ages in the shadow of your lashes
