The Man and the Sea

Free man, you will always cherish the sea!
The sea is your mirror; you contemplate your soul
In the infinite rolling of its surface,
And your spirit is no less a bitter chasm.

It pleases you to dive in the breast of your image;
You embrace the eyes and the arms, and your heart
Distracts itself sometimes with its own clamor
Of noise of this complaint indomitable and savage.

You are both dark and discreet:
Man, none have plumbed the depth of your abyss;
O sea, none know your intimate riches,
Since you jealously guard all your secrets!

Despite this, for innumerable centuries
You've battled each other without pity or remorse,
You so love the carnage and the death,
Oh eternal fighters, oh implacable brothers!
