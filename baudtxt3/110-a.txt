Misfortune

To support such a heavy weight,
Sisyphus, one must have your strength
Well, who would have the heart for such a feat?
Art is long and time is short


Far from the famous crypts
Toward a lonely cemetery
My heart like a muffled drum
Proceeds, beating funeral marches

Many a jewel sleeps buried
In the darkness and oblivion
Far from the picks and probes

Many a flower exhales with regret
Its soft perfume like a secret
In the deep solitude
