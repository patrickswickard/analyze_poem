The Offended Moon

Oh moon who was discreetly loved by our fathers,
Above in the blue country with a radiant harem,
Of stars which follow you in dapper attire,
My old Cynthia, lamp of our lairs,

Do you see the lovers on their prosperous pallets,
Sleeping, mouths showing the white of their teeth?
The poet, late working, striking his forehead?
Or the vipers breeding under the dry grass?

Under your yellow cloak, do you go,
Do you tiptoe, as before, from evening to morning,
To kiss Endymion with old-fashioned graces?

"I see your mother, child of this impoverished century,
Who bends toward her mirror a heavy mass of years,
And artfully plasters the breast that nourished you!"
