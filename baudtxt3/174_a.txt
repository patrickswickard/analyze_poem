Sadnesses of the Moon

This evening, the moon dreams with more laziness;
Like a beauty, reclining on a number of cushions,
Who with a hand distracting and light caresses
The contour of her breasts before falling asleep,

On the satiny back of soft avalanches,
Dying, she indulges in long swoons,
And casts her eyes about the pale visions
That rise in the blue like flowers.

When sometimes on the globe, in her idle langour,
She lets slip a furtive cry,
A pious poet, enemy of sleep,

In the hollow of his hand takes this pale noise,
Of iridescent reflections like a shard of opal,
And puts it in his heart far from the eyes of the sun.
