Sadnesses of the Moon

This evening, the moon dreams with more laziness
Thus like a beauty, on a number of cushions
Which with a distracting hand and light caress
Before falling asleep the contour of her breasts

On the satiny back of soft avalanches
Dying, she indulges in long swoons
And casting her eyes about the pale visions
That are shown in the blue like flowers

When sometimes on the globe in her idle langour
She lets slip a furtive cry
A pious poet, enemy of sleep

In the hollow of his hand takes this pale noise
Of iridescent reflections like a shard of opal
And puts it in his heart far from the eyes of the sun
