The Giantess

In days when Nature in its powerful rapture
Conceived every day monstrous children,
I would have loved to live with a young giantess,
Like a voluptuous cat at the feet of a queen.

I would have loved to see her body blooming with its soul
And growing freely with her terrible games;
To divine whether a dark flame burned in her heart
By the humid mists that swam in her eyes;

Browsing at leisure her magificent form;
To crawl on the slopes of her enormous lap,
And sometimes, in summer, when the unhealthy suns

Make her stretch out, weary, along the countryside
I would sleep nonchalant in the shadow of her breasts,
Like a peaceful village at the foot of a mountain.
