Destruction

The demon ceaselessly moves by my side
He swims around me like an impalpable air
I swallow him and he burns down in my lung
And fills it with a guilty eternal desire

Sometimes, knowing my great love of Art
He takes the form of a woman most seductive
And under false pretexts he accustoms
My lip to the most infamous potions

He leads me thus, far from the gaze of God
Panting and broken by fatigue, to the midst
Of the plains of boredom, deep and deserted

And throws in my eyes full of confusion
The soiled garments, the open wounds
And the bloodied tools of Destruction
