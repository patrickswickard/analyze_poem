Correspondences

Nature is a temple where the living pillars
Sometimes let escape confused words;
Man passes there through the forest of symbols
And observes it with a familiar regard.

Like the long echos mixing in the distance
In a shadowy and profound unity,
Vast like the night and like the light,
The perfumes, the colors, and the sounds respond.

There are perfumes cool like the skin of children,
Soft like oboes, green like prairies;
And others, corrupt, rich and triumphant,

With the power to expand to infinite things,
Like amber, musk, resin and incense,
Who sing the transport of the spirits and senses.
