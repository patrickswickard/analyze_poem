The Beacons

Rubens, river of oblivion, garden of laziness,
Pillow of cool flesh where one may not love,
But where life moves and flows ceaselessly,
Like the air in the sky and the sea in the sea;

Leonardo da Vinci, mirror deep and dark,
Where the charming angels, with a soft smile
All charged with mystery, appear in the shadow
Of glaciers and pines which enclose their country;

Rembrandt, sad hospital full of sighs,
And decorated only with a great crucifix,
Where rubbish exhales a tearful prayer,
And a ray of winter came in suddenly;

Michelangelo, vague place where one sees Hercules
Mixing with Christ and rising straight up
The powerful phantoms who in the twilight
Rip their robes in stretching their fingers;

Angers of the boxer, impudences of the faun,
You who gather the beauty of cads,
Great heart full of pride, man feeble and yellow,
Puget, melancholic emperor of convicts;

Watteau, this carnival of illustrious hearts,
Like butterflies, wandering on the wing,
Decorations fresh and light, lit by chandeliers
Which madly swing in this spinning ball;

Goya, nightmare full of unknown things,
Fetuses cooked in a black sabbath,
Old women in a mirror and children fully nude,
To tempt the demons adjusting their stockings;

Delacroix, lake of blood haunted by evil angels,
Shadowed by a wood of evergreen firs,
Where, under a sad sky, strange fanfares
Pass, like a stifled sigh of Weber;

These maledictions, these blasphemies, these plaints,
These ecstasies, these cries, these tears, these Te Deums
Are an echo repeated through a thousand labyrinths;
For mortal hearts they are an opium divine!

It is a cry repeated by a thousand sentinels,
An order passed on by a thousand megaphones;
It is a beacon lit on a thousand citadels,
A call of hunters lost in the great woods!

Thus it is truly, Lord, the best testimony
That we can give of our dignity
That this ardent sob rolls on age to age
And comes to die on your eternity's shore!
