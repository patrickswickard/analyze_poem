I have not forgotten, neighboring the city

I have not forgotten, neighboring the city,
Our white house, small but tranquil;
Its plaster Pomona and its old Venus
Their bare limbs hidden in a paltry grove,
And the sun in the evening, streaming superbly,
Through the glass that broke and scattered its rays
Great eye in the curious sky,
Seemed to contemplate our long silent dinners,
Spreading wide its beautiful reflections like candles
On the frugal table cloth and the curtains of serge.
