I have not forgotten, neighboring the city

I have not forgotten, neighboring the city
Our white house, small but tranquil
Its plaster Pomona and its old Venus
Their bare limbs hidden in a paltry grove
And the sun in the evening, which streamed superbly
Through the glass that broke and scattered its rays
Seemed a great eye in the curious sky
Contemplating our long and silent dinners,
Spreading wide its beautiful reflections like candles
On the frugal table cloth and the curtains of serge
