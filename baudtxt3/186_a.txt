The Metamorphoses of the Vampire

Meanwhile the woman, from her fresh mouth,
Twisting thus like a serpent in the ashes,
And kneading her breasts against the iron of her corset,
Let pour out these words, infused with musk:
"Me, I have wet lips, and I know the science
Of losing antique morals in the depths of a bed.
I dry every tear on my triumphant breasts,
And make the old laugh with the laughter of children.
For those who see me nude, without veils, I replace
The moon and the sun, the sky and the stars!
I am, my dear wise one, so learned in delights,
When I smother a man in my dreadful arms,
Or for suckling and biting I offer my breasts,
Timid and libertine, fragile and robust,
Upon this mattress which swoons with passion,
The powerless angels would damn themselves for me!"

When she had sucked all the marrow from my bones,
And I langourously turned myself toward her
To render a kiss of love, I saw no more
Than a wineskin with sticky sides, filled up with pus!
In my cold terror I closed both my eyes,
And when I reopened them to the vivid light,
At my side, instead of a powerful doll
Which seemed to have gorged itself upon blood,
Trembled in confusion the debris of a skeleton,
Who still rendered the creak of a weather-vane
Or a sign that hangs on a rod of iron,
Swinging in the wind in the winter nights.
