The Poison

The wine disguises the most sordid dive
With a miraculous luxury
And makes emerge more than one fabulous portico
In the gold of its red vapor
Like a setting sun in a hazy sky

Opium expands that which has no borders
Stretching out limitless
Deepening time, hollowing out voluptuousness
And the pleasures dark and sad
That fill the soul beyond its capacity

All that is not worth the poison that issues
From your eyes, from your green eyes
Lakes where my soul trembles and sees itself mirrored
My dreams come in a crowd
To quench themselves in these bitter gulfs

All that is not worth the terrible miracle
Of your saliva that bites
That dives remorselessly into the void of my soul,
Carrying vertigo,
And rolls it swooning to the banks of Death.
