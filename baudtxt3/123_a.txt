Sed non satia

Bizarre deity, brown like the nights
In a mix of smells of musk and Havana
Work of a magician, Faust and the savanna
Sorcerer at the side of ebony, child of black midnights

I prefer in constance, in opium, in nights
The elixir in the mouth of drooling love
When toward you my desires depart in a caravan
Your eyes are the cistern where my boredoms drink

Through these great dark eyes, sighs of your soul
Oh pitiless demon! Pour me less flame
I am not the Styx for embracing you ninefold

Alas! I'm unable, shrewish bitch libertine
To tame you and keep you at bay
In the hell of your bed and become Proserpine
