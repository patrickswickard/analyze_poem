Spleen

When the sky low and heavy like a lid
On the groaning spirit, prey of long ennuis
And whose horizon embraces all the circle
It pours one black day sadder than the nights

When the earth is changed into a dank dungeon
Where hope, like a bat goes to leave,
Banging its timid wings on the walls
And bumping its head on the filthy ceiling

When the rain spreading out its enormous trails
A vast prison, imitating the bars
And a mute crowd of wretched spiders
Spins their webs at the bottom of our brains

The bells suddenly jump with fury
And launch toward the sky a frightful howl
As wandering spirits without a homeland
Who start to let out a stubborn moan

And along the hearses without bells or music
File slowly by in my soul; vanquished hope
And Anguish, atrocious, despotic, then plants
Its black flag on my inclined skull
