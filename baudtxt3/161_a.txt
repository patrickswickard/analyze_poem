Spleen

When the sky low and heavy like a lid
On the groaning spirit, prey of long ennuis,
And whose horizon embraces all the circle
It pours one black day sadder than the nights;

When the earth is changed into a dank dungeon,
Where hope, like a bat goes to leave,
Banging its timid wings on the walls
And bumping its head on the filthy ceiling;

When the rain spreading out its enormous trails
A vast prison, imitating the bars,
And a mute crowd of wretched spiders comes
To spin their webs at the bottom of our brains,

The bells suddenly leap with fury
And launch toward the sky a frightful howl,
Like wandering spirits without a homeland
Who start to let out a stubborn moan.

And the hearses, without bells or music,
File slowly along in my soul; Hope, being vanquished,
Cries, and Anguish, atrocious and despotic,
Plants its black flag on my inclined skull
