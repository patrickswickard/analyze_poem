The Serpent Who Dances

How I love to see, dear lazy girl,
From your body so beautiful
You skin glistening
Like a waving cloth

On your rich head of hair
In acrid perfum
A sea fragrant and flowing
In floods of blues and browns

Like a ship that wakes up
In the wind of the morning
My dreaming soul casts off
For a faraway sky

Your eyes, where nothing is revealed
Neither sweet nor bitter
Are two cold jewels that mix
Iron with gold

To see you marching in cadence
Unrestrained beauty,
One would call you a serpent dancing
At the end of a staff

Under the burden of your laziness
Your childlike head
Sways with the softness
Of a young elephant

And your body which leans and stretches
Like a fine vessel
That rolls coast to coast and dives
Its spar in the water

Like a flood caused by the thawing
Of rumbling glaciers
When the water of your mouth rises
Next to your teeth

I believe I am drinking Bohemian wine
Bitter and victorious
A liquid sky that sprinkles
From the stars to my heart
