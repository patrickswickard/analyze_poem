The Bad Monk

On the grand murals of ancient cloisters
Spread out a tableau of sainted Virtue,
Whose effects warmed the bowels of the pious,
And tempered the coldness of their austerity.

In those times when Christ did make flourish the crops
More than one illustrious monk, today seldom quoted,
Taking for inspiration the graveyard,
Glorified Death with simplicity.

My soul is a tomb, terrible monk,
Where I live and dwell eternally;
Nothing ebellishes the walls of this odious cloister.

Oh good-for-nothing monk! When will I therefore know
How to make a spectacle of my miserable sadness
The work of my hands and the love of my eyes?
