Former Life

I have lived for a long time under the vast porticos
Which the seaside suns had tinted with a thousand fires,
And their great pillars, upright and majestic,
Seemed in the evening like grottos of basalt.

The rolling waves carried the images of the sky,
Mixed in a fashion mystical and solemn
The all powerful harmonies of their rich music
Reflected the images of the sunset to my eyes.

It is there that I lived in the calm delight,
In the midst of the blue, the waves, the splendors,
And the naked slaves, all pregnant with odors,

Who cooled my forehead with fronds of palms,
And which only served to deepen for me
The secret sadness that made me languish.
