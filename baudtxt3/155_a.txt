The Cats

Both fervent lovers and the austere sages
Love equally in their maturity
Cats soft and powerful, pride of the household
Sedentary like them and sensitive to cold

Companions of knowledge and of sensual pleasure
They seek the silence and the darkness's horror
Erebus would use them as his coursers
If he could press their pride into his service

They take in dreaming noble attitudes
Of sphinxes grand in deepest solitudes
Who seem to slumber in an endless dream

Their fertile loins are full of magic sparks
And particles of gold, just like fine sand
Glitter vaguely in mysterious eyes
