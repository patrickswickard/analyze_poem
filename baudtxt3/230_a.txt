The Dream of a Curious Man
 
for Felix Nadar

Do you know, like me, the delicious sadness
And say to yourself, "Oh peculiar man!"
I was going to die.  In my amorous soul
Was a desire mixed with horror, a particular evil;

Anguish and deep hope, no passing fancy.
The more the deadly hourglass emptied,
The more bitter and delicious was my torture;
My whole heart was uprooted from the mundane world.

I was like a child, avid for the spectacle,
Hating the curtain like one hates an obstacle...
Finally the cold truth revealed itself:

I was dead.  There was no surprise
And the terrible truth dawned on me.  What? Is that all there is?
The curtain had risen and I waited still.
