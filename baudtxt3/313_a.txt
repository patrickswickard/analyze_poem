The Eyes of Berthe

You can despise the most famous eyes,
Beautiful eyes of my child, through which filter
Some unknown thing, sweet and soft as the night!
Beautiful eyes, pour your dark charms upon me!

Big eyes of my child, arcane and adored,
You greatly resemble those antique grottoes
Where, behind the mass of lethargic shadows,
Ignored treasures vaguely sparkle!

My child with obscure eyes, deep and vast,
Like you, immense Night, lit like you!
Your fires are the thoughts of Love mixed with Faith,
Which sparkle in the depths, voluptuous or chaste.
