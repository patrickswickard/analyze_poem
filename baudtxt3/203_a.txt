Hair

Oh fleece! Fluffy down to her neckline
Oh curls! Oh perfume full of carelessness!
Ecstasy! To populate this obscure alcove
Of dormant memories in this hair,
I want to wave it in the wind like a handkerchief

Langorous Asia and burning Africa
The whole world distant, absent, almost defunct,
Lives in your depths, aromatic forest!
Like other spirits swim on music, my love,
Mine swim on your perfume.

I would go there where the tree and the man, full of sap,
Swoon for a long time under the ardor of the climate
Strong tresses, be the wave which lifts me!
You contain, ebony sea, a dazzling dream
Of sails, of rowers, of flames and masts

A resounding port where my soul can drink
A great wave of perfume, the sound and the color
Where the vessels, gleaming with gold and moire
Open their vast arms to embrace the glory
A sky where the eternal heat quivers

I shall plunge my head enamoured with drunkenness
Into this black ocean where the other is imprisoned
And my subtle spirit caressed by the curls
On the downy edges of your twisted locks
I ardently get drunk on the confusing scents
Of coconut oil, of musk and tar

For a long time! Always! My hand in your heavy mane
Will plant the ruby, the pearl, the sapphire,
Until you can no longer be deaf to my desire!
Are you not the oasis I dream of, and the gourd
Where I take long gulps of the wine of memory?
