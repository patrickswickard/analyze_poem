The Jewels

The lovely one was naked, and, knowing my heart,
She had guarded only her most resonant jewels
Whose rich glitter gave her the conquering air
Of Moorish slave girls in their happiest days

When it makes such a vivid and mocking noise,
This radiant world dancing, with its metal and stone,
I am eager with ecstasy and love the furor
Of the melange of all things, where sound mixes with light

She thus had reclined and let herself be loved
And atop the divan she smiled with ease
At my love, deep and soft like the sea
Mounting toward her as if lapping against a cliff

Eyes fixed on me like a tigress tamed
With an attitude vague and dreamy, she posed
And innocence mixed with lechery gave
Her metamorphoses a novel charm

And her arm and her leg, her thigh and her waist
Shining as if oiled, sinuous like a swan,
Passed before my eyes, clear and serene
And her belly and breasts, these grapes on my vine

She advanced, more seductive than a fallen angel
To disrupt the idle repose of my soul
And to disturb the rock of crystal
Where it had been sitting, calm and alone

I believed I was seeing in a novel design
Antiope's hips on the torso of a boy,
A waistline that gave it an hourglass curve.
On her olive brown skin her make-up was superb

When the lamp allowed itself to die
When the room was lit by the fire's glow alone
Whenever the flame gave a flamboyant sigh
Her amber skin flushed, inundated with blood
