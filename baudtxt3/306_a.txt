Thoughts at Midnight

The clock, sounding midnight,
Ironically calls us
To recall how we used
The fleeing day:
Today, fateful day
Friday the thirteenth, we have,
Despite everything we know,
Lived as a heretic.

We have blasphemed Jesus,
The most incontestable God!
Like a parasite at the table
Of some monstrous Croesus,
We have, to please the brute,
Dignified vassal of Demons,
Insulted what we love
And flattered what we hate;

Grieved for, servile executioner,
The feeble one wrongly accused;
Saluted enormous Stupidity,
Stupidity with the brow of a bull
Kissed idiotic Materialism
With great devotion,
And blessed the pale light
Of putrefaction.

Finallyi, to drown
The dizzying clans that delight
We, proud priests of the Lyre
Whose glory it is to deploy
The intoxication of funereal things,
Drunk without thirst, and eaten without hunger!
Let's quickly blow out the lamp,
So that we may hide in the darkness!
