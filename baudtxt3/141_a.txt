The Spiritual Dawn

When dawn breaks, pale and red, at the bawdy house
In the company of the gnawing Ideal,
Through the works of a vengeful mystery
Within the drowsy brute awakens an angel

The spiritual sky, the blue unreachable,
For the man on the ground who still dreams and suffers,
Who struggles and is immersed by the lure of the abyss.
Thus, dear goddess, Being lucid and pure,

On the fuming debris of stupid orgies
Your memory more clear, more pink, more charming,
Ceaselessly vaults for my widened eyes.

The sun has darkened the flame of the candles;
Thus, always triumphant, your spirit is the same,
Glimmering soul, as the immortal sun!
