The spiritual dawn

When dawn breaks, pale and red, at the bawdy house
This society of the ideal brothel rat
Through the works of an unknown avenger
In the soul of the drowsy brute awakens an angel

The spiritual sky, the blue unreachable
For the man on the ground who still dreams and suffers
Who struggles and is immersed by the lure of the abyss
Thus, dear goddess, Being lucid and pure

On the fuming debris of stupid orgies
Your memory more clear, more pink, more charming
Ceaselessly vaulting for my widened eyes

The sun has darkened the flame of the candles
Thus, always triumphant, your spirit is the same,
Glimmering soul, as the immortal sun
