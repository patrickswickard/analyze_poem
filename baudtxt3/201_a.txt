The Mask

Allegorical statue in the style of the Renaissance

To Ernest Christophe, sculptor

Let's contemplate this treasure of florentine grace
On the indulation of the muscular body
Elegance and the Strength abound, divine sisters.
This woman, a truly miraculous piece,
Divinely robust, adorably slender
And made to enthrone on sumptuous beds
And charm the leisures of a pontiff or prince

Also, behold this smile, fine and voluptuous
Where Fatuity parades his ecstasy
This long and sly regard, langourous and mocking
This adorable visage, framed in gauze
In which every trait speaks to us with a winning air
"Voluptuousness calls me and love crowns me!"
This being is endowed with such majesty
See this exciting charm the kindness gives!
Let's approach, and turn toward her beauty.

Oh blasphy of art! Oh fatal surprise!
The woman with a divine body, promising happiness
Terminates at the top in a monster with two heads!

But no! This is only a mask, a deceptive ornament
This clear face with an exquisite grimace
And, regard here, atrociously tense,
The true head, and the sincere face
Reversed and sheltered by the lying face
Poor great beauty! The magnificent river
Of your tears end up in my worried heart
I am drunk on your lie, and my soul gulps
In floods from the Sadness that pours from your eyes.

But why does she cry? She, perfect beauty
Who could have at her feet the vanquished human race
What mysterious evil gnaws at her athletic flank

She cries insensibly, because she has lived!
And because she now lives! But what she hates
Above all what makes her knees tremble
Is that tomorrow, alas! She must live again
Tomorrow, after tomorrow, and always--like us!
