All In One Piece

The demon in my high chamber
This morning came to see me
And, trying to catch me at fault
Said to me: "I would like to know

Among all the beautiful things
Which are made for your enchantment,
Among the things black or pink
That compose her charming body,

Which is the most soft." - Ah my soul!
You responded to this Abombination:
"Since all of her is balm,
There is nothing I can prefer.

Since everything pleases me, I ignore
If some part seduces me.
She dazzles like the Dawn
And consoles me like the Night;

And the harmony is too exquisite
That governs her whole beautiful body
To analyze powerlessly
And note the numerous accords.

O mystic metamorphosis
Of all my senses melted into one!
Your breathing makes a music
Like your voice makes a perfume!"
