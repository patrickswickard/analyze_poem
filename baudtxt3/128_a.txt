The Vampire

You who, like the cut of a knife
Enters into my plaintive heart
You who came, strong like a troop
Of demons, mad and well-adorned

From my humbled spirit
Make your bed and your domain
Notorious woman to whom I'm bound
Like a convict to a chain

Like a stubborn gambler to a game
Like a drunkard to a bottle
Like the vermin to a corpse
Damned, be damned, you!

I have begged the rapid blade
To win my liberty
And I have asked the vicious poison
To aid my cowardice

Alas! The poison and the blade
With disdain said to me
"You are not worthy to raise up
From cursed slavery

Imbecile! If our efforts
Delivered you from her empire
Your own kisses would revive
The corpse of your vampire!"
