The Irremediable

I

An Idea, a Shape, a Being
Which left the blue sky and fell
Into a Styx muddy and leaden
Where no eye of Heaven penetrates;

An Angel, imprudent voyager
Who attempted to deform love,
At the bottom of an enormous nightmare
Struggling like a swimmer.

And fighting, Oh morbid anguish,
Against a gigantic whirlpool
Who goes singing like the mad
And spinning in the darkness;

An unhappy ensorceled one
In his futile groping
To flee a place full of reptiles,
Seeks the light and the key;

A damned fallen one without a lamp
Next to an abyss where the smell
Reveals the humid depth
Of eternal stairs without rails,

Where slimy monsters keep guard
Whose large phosphorescent eyes
Make the night still blacker
And make visible only themselves;

A ship taken to the polar waters
Like a crystal trap,
Searching for a fatal strait
It has fallen into this gaol;

Clear emblems, perfect tableau
Of an irremediable fortune
Which makes one think of the Devil
Who always does what he wants!

II

Head to head, somber and limpid
The heart becomes its own mirror!
Well of Truth, clear and black
Where trembles a livid star;

An ironic beacon, infernal,
Flame of satanic grace,
Relief and unique glory,
The conscience in Evil!
