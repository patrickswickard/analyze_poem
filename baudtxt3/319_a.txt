The Abyss

Pascal had his abyss, which moved with him
Alas! All is abysmal--action, desire, dreaming
Words! And many a time I feel Fear pass in the wind
Above my hair which stands on end

Above, below, everywhere, in the depths, on the shore
The silence, the space frightful and captivating,
At the bottom of my nights God points his knowing finger
And sketches a nightmare for me, multiform and endless

I fear sleep as one fears a great hole
Full of great horror, leading where no one knows
I see nothing but the infinite through every windows

And my spirit, always haunted by dizziness
Is jealous of the insensibility of nothing
Ah! Never stray from Numbers and from Beings
