The Lid

Anywhere he goes, on the land or on the sea
Under a climate that burns or under a white sun
Servant of Jesus, courtesan of Cytherea
Shadowy beggar or shining Croesus

Citizen, country dweller, vagabond, layabout,
Whose brain may be active or slow
Everywhere man suffers the terror of mystery
And only looks up with a trembling eye

Above, the Sky! The wall of the crypt which smothers him
Ceiling lit with a comic opera
Where every player treads on bloody ground

Terror of the libertine, hope of the mad hermit
The sky! Black lid of the large cauldron
Where vast and imperceptible mankind boils
