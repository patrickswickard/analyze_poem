Landscape

I want, to chastely compose my eclogues,
To lie down near the sky like an astrologer,
And, while I dream near the bell towers
Sounding their solemn hymns carried on the wind.
Both hands on my chin, above in my attic,
I'll see the workshops where sing and chatter;
The pipes, the steeples, the masts of the city,
And the grand skies that make one dream of eternity.

It is sweet, through the mists, to see born
The star in the blue, the lamp in the window
The rivers of coal smoke that climb to the sky,
And the moon pouring out its pale enchantment.
I will see in spring, in summer, in fall;
And when winter comes with its monotone snows,
I will close all around the windows and shutters
To build in the night my fairytale palace.
Thus I will dream of bluish horizons,
Of gardens, of alabaster fountains that cry,
Of kisses, of birds singing evening and morning,
And all the most childlike things in this Idyll.
The Chaos, storming vainly at my window,
Will not raise my brow from my desk;
So I will have plunged into this pleasure
Of evoking spring with my will,
Of pulling the sun to my heart, and of making
From my burning thoughts a warm atmosphere.
