A Phantom

I. The Shadows

In the caverns of inestimable sadness
To which Destiny has already relegated me
Where never enters a ray pink and gay
Where there is only Night, gloomy hostess

I am like a painter whom a mocking God
Has condemned to paint in the darkness, alas!
Where, cooking for morbid appetites
I boil and eat my own heart

At times a spectre made of grace and splendor
Shines and stretches out 
In its dreamy oriental allure
When it reaches its total grandeur
I recognize my beautiful visitor

It is she, dark and luminous!

II. The Perfume

Reader, have you sometimes breathed
Ecstatically and slowly savoring
This grain of incense which fills a church
Or the long-standing musk of a sachet?

Deep magical charm which makes us tipsy
And restores in the present the past
Thus the lover of a body adored
Picks an exquisite flower from memory

In her hair elastic and heavy
Living sachet, scenting the alcove
A scent rises, savage and wild

And the gowns, muslin and velvet
Are impregnated with her pure youth
Letting off the perfume of fur

III. The Frame

Like a beautiful frame adds to a painting
Which, though done with a highly-praised brush,
It isolates it from enormous Nature
And gives it a strangeness and charm

Thus jewels, furnishings, metals and gold
Adapt to her rare beauty
Nothing obscures the perfect clarity
And all seem to make for her a frame

One would even says sometimes she believes
That everything wants to love her; she drowns
Voluptuously her nudity

In the kisses of satin and linen
And, slow and brusque, with every movement
Shows the childish grace of a monkey

IV. The Portrait

Disease and death make ashes
Of everything that burns for us
Of the great eyes so fervent and tender
Of this mouth where my heart drowns

Of those strong kisses like a balm
Of the transports more vibrant than sun rays
What remains? It is awful, my soul!
Nothing but a pale sketch, in three colors

Which like me dies in the solitude
And like Time, injurious old man
Every day rubs with a rough wing...

Black assassin of Life and of Art
You will never kill within my memory
She who was my pleasure and my glory!
