The Promises of a Face

Oh pale beauty, I love your lowered eyebrows,
From which seem to flow darkness;
Your eyes, though quite dark, do not
Inspire in me any morbid thoughts.

Your eyes, which match the blackness of your hair,
With its bouncy mane,
Your langourous eyes say to me, "If you want,
Lover of the pliant muse,

Follow the hope that I excite in you,
And all the tastes that you profess,
You'll verify our veracity
From the navel to the buttocks;

You'll find at the end of two great heavy breasts,
Two large medallions of bronze,
And under a smooth belly, soft as velvet,
Brown like the skin of a monk,

A rich muff that truly is the sister
Of that enormous head of hair above,
Supple and curly, and equally thick,
A night without stars, a night obscure!"
