On "Le Tasse en prison" by Eug√®ne Delacroix

The poet in the dungeon, dissheveled and sickly,
Rolling a manuscript under his convulsive foot,
Gazes enflamed by terror at the dizzying stairway
Where his soul tumbles down into the abyss.

The delirious laughter which fills the prison
Invites his reason twoard the strange and absurd;
Doubt surrounds him and Fear ridicules him,
Hideous and multiform, circulating around him.

This genius imprisoned in an unhealthy hovel,
These grimaces, these cries, these specters which swarm
Turbulently, moving behind his ear,

This dreamer who is wakened by the horror of his lodgings,
There is his emblem, Soul of obscure dreams,
Whom Reality smothers within these four walls!
