The Sick Muse

My poor muse, alas! What ails you this morning?
Your hollow eyes are full of nocturnal visions,
And I see over and over reflected in your complexion
The folly and horror, cold and taciturn.

The greenish succubus and the pink pixie--
Have they poured out the fear and the love from their urns?
The nightmare, from a despotic and mutinous fist--
Has it drowned you at the bottom of a fabulous Minturne?

I would like that your breast, exhaling the odor
Of health, in which strong inspirations always dwelled,
And where your Christian blood ran in rhythmic flows,

Like the numerous sounds of antique syllables,
Where reigned time after time the father of songs,
Phoebus, and great Pan, the teacher of harvests.
