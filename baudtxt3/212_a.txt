Sonnet of Autumn

They ask me, your eyes, clear like crystal:
"For you, bizarre lover, what then is my merit?"
Be charming and hush! My heart, which all annoys
Except the candor animals of old,

Never wants to show its infernal secret,
The lullaby whose hand invites me to long sleep,
Nor its dark legend written in flame.
I hate the passion and the spirit does me harm!

Let us love each other softly. Love in his turret,
Dark, ambushing, bends his fatal bow.
I know the tools in his old arsenal:

Crime, horror, and madness! Oh pale daisy!
Like me are you not an autumnal sun,
Oh my Marguerite, so pale and so cold?
