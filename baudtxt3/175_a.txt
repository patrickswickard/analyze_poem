Music

Music often carries me like the sea!
Toward my pale star
Under a ceiling of mist or in a vast ether
I take sail.

My chest forward and my lungs full
Like the canvas
I climb the backs of accumulated floods
Veiled by the night

I feel quiver in me all the passions
Of a ship that founders
The good wind, the tempest and its convulsions

On the immense abyss
I am rocked. At other times, becalmed, great mirror
Of my despair!
