The Murderer's Wine

My wife is dead, I am free!
I can therefore drink to my heart's content
Whenever I came home penniless
Her cries would drive me mad

I am happy as a king
The air is pure, the sky admirable
We had a similar summer
When I fell in love with her!

The horrible thirst that tears at me
To be satisfied would need
As much wine as her tomb can hold
And that is quite a lot

I threw her to the bottom of a well
And then dropped down on her
All the stones from around the edge
I'd forget her if I could

In the name of oaths of tenderness
Of which nothing could relieve us
And in order to reconcile us
Like the beautiful time of our drunkenness

I invited her on a meeting
In the evening on an obscure route
She came there, mad creature
We were both more than a little mad

She was still happy
Although a bit tired! And I,
I loved her too much! There is why
I told her: leave this life!

None can understand me. Did one
Among these stupid drunkards
Dream in his most morbid nights
Of making a shroud of wine?

This invulnerable scoundrel
Like machines of iron
Never, neither in summer nor winter
Has really known true love

With its black enchantments,
Its infernal procession of alarms
Its vials of poison, its tears
The noises of chains and bones

I am finally free and alone!
I will be this evening dead drink
Because, without fear of remorse
I can lie down the ground

And sleep just like a dog!
The carriage with heavy wheels
Burdened with stones and with mud
The angry wagon can then

Crush my guilty head
Or cut my body in two
I mock that as I do God,
The Devil or the sacraments!
