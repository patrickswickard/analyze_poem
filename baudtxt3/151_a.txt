L'Héautontimorouménos (The Self-Harmer)

For J.G.F.

I strike you without anger
And without hate, like a butcher,
Like Moses with the rock!
And from your eyes,

To water my Sahara,
I make flow the tears of suffering.
My desire swollen with the hope
Of swimming on your salty tears

Like a ship striking the mainsail,
And in my heart which drinks
Of your resounding sobs
Like a drum beats the charge!

Am I not a misstruck note
Within the divine symphony,
Thanks to the voracious Irony
That shakes me and bites me?

It is in my voice, the criea!r
All my blood is a black poison!
I am a sinister mirror
In which the shrew regards herself.

I am the wound and the knife!
I am the slap and the cheek!
I am the limb and the wheel,
I am the victim and the executioner!

I am the vampire of my heart,
One of the great abandoned
Condemned eternally to laughter
But who can never again smile!
