L'Héautontimorouménos (The Self-Harmer)

I strike you without anger
And without hate, like a kiss
Like Moses with the rock!
And from your eyes

To water my Sahara
I make flow the tears of suffering
My desire swollen with the hope
Of swimming on your salty tears

Like a ship striking the mainsail
And in my heart which drinks
Of your resounding sobs
Like a drum beats the charge

Am I not a misstruck note
Within the divine symphony
Thanks to the voracious Irony
That shakes me and bites me?

It is in my voice, the crier
All my blood is a black poison
I am a sinister mirror
In which the shrew regards herself

I am the wound and the knife
I am the bellows and the cheek
I am the limb and the wheel
I am the victim and the executioner

I am the vampire of my heart
One of the great abandoned
Condemned to laughter by the eternal
But who can never again smile!
