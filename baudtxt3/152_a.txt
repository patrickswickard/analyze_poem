I'll sing to you on new strings

I'll sing to you on new strings;
Oh young one who plays
In the heart's solitude.

Be entwined in wreaths,
Oh delicate woman
Through whom our sins are absolved!

Like the beneficent Lethe,
I sip kisses from you,
You are imbued with a magnet.

When the storm of vices
Disturbed all the paths,
You appeared, oh Deity,

Like a guiding star
Above a bitter shipwreck...
I hang my heart on your altar!

A pool full of virtue,
Fountain of eternal youth
Give voice to mute lips!

What was unclean, you burned;
What was rough, you have smoothed;
What was weak, you have fortified.

In my hunger you are my tavern
In the night you are my lamp,
Always guide me true.

Add your strength to mine,
Sweet and pleasant bath
Anointed with perfumes!

Around my loins glisten,
A chastity belt,
Dipped in seraphic water;

A jeweled cup glitters,
Salty bread, soft meat,
Divine wine, Francisca!
