The Sun

Along the old suburb, where hang in hovels
The Parisians, a shelter of luxurious secrets
When the cruel sun strikes with blows redoubled
On the city and the fields, on the roofs and the wheat,
I want to exercise alone in my fantastic fencing,
Smelling out in all the corners the accidental rhyme
Stumbling on the words like on the paving stones
Striking sometimes long dreamed-of verses

This nourishing father, enemy of anemia
Wakes in the fields the verses like the roses
He makes the worries evaporate toward the sky
And fills the brain and the honey in the hives
He is he who rejuvenates those on crutches
And makes them soft and gay as young maidens
And commands at the harvest the growth and the ripening
In the immortal heart which always flowers!

When, thus to a poet, He descends in the cities
He ennobles the fate of the most worthless things
And introduces himself to the king, without noise or valets
In all the hospitals and in all the palaces
