To M. Eugène Fromentin with regards to a jerk who claimed to be his friend

He told me he was very rich
But he was afraid of cholera
That he was very frugal with his money
But had a strong taste for the Opera

That he had a passion for Nature,
Having known Monsieur Corot
That he didn't have a carriage yet
But one was coming soon

That he loved marble and brick
Ebony and gilded wood
That in his factory he had
Three foremen who were decorated

That he had without counting the rest
Twenty thousand shares in Le Nord
That he had scored some picture frames
For cheap by Oppenord

He'd gone as far as to Luzarches
For bric-a-brac up to his neck
And at the Marché des Patriarches
He'd found more than one good bargain

He didn't love his wife too much
Nor his mother, but he believed
In the soul's immortality
And he had read Niboyet

He had a penchant for good sex
And on a boring trip to Rome
A woman in the throes of TB
Had died of love for him

For three and a half long hours
This chatterbox from Tournai
Rambled to me of his whole life
To my poor brain's dismay

If I told you all I suffered there
I'd never reach the end
I told myself, stifling my hate
"If only I could fall asleep"

Like one who is unsatisfied
But doesn't dare to leave
I rubbed my ass against my chair
Imagining myself impaled

This monster by the name Bastogne
Was fleeing from the plague
I'd have fled all the way to Gascogne
Or thrown myself in the water

Yes, in this Paris, which he hates
When everyone has returned
I once more find along my route
This plague who's from Tournai
