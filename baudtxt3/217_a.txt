Sympathetic Horror

From the sky bizarre and livid,
Tormented like your destiny,
What thoughts descend in your empty soul?
Answer, libertine!

Insatiably avid
From the obscure and uncertain,
I will not groan like Ovid
Chased from his Latin paradise.

Skies torn like the shores
You mirror my pride;
Your vast clouds of mourning

Are the funeral coaches of my dreams,
And your glows are the reflections
Of the hell which pleases my heart.
