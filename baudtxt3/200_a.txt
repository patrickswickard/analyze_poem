The Albatross

Often, for amusement, the men of the crew
Take albatrosses, vast birds of the sea,
Who follow, lazy companions of the voyage,
The ship gliding along the bitter abyss.

As soon as they've been cast down on the planks,
These kings of the sky, clumsy and shamed,
Pitifully let their great white wings
Drag along their sides like oars.

This winged voyager, how awkward and frail!
So handsome before, now ugly and absurd!
One sailor stuffs in his beak a lit pipe,
Another apes drunkenly this cripple who flew!

The Poet is like this prince of the clouds
Who rides the storm and mocks the archer;
Exiled on the earth in the midst of the jeers,
His steps impeded by his enormous wings.
