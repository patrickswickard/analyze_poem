Love and the skull

Base of an old lamp

Love is seated on the skull
Of humanity,
And on this throne this profane being,
Laughing shamelessly,

Gaily blows round bubbles
That climb into the air,
As if to join the world
With the deepest ether.

The frail shining globe
Makes a great flight,
Punctured and spitting its delicate soul
Like a golden dream.

I hear the skull with every bubble
Begging and complaining:
--"This vicious game is absurd,
When must it end?

Since that with which your cruel mouth
Scatters in the air,
Monstrous assassin, it is my brain,
My blood and my flesh!"
