Love and the skull

Base of an old lamp

Love is seated on the skull
Of humanity
And on this throne this profane being
Laughs shamelessly

Gaily blowing round bubbles
That climb into the air
As if to join the world
With the deepest ether

The frail shining globe
Makes a great flight
Punctured, spitting its delicate soul
Like a golden dream

I hear the skull with every bubble
Begging and complaining
--"This vicious game is absurd
When must it end?

Since that with which your cruel mouth
Scatters the air
Monster, assassin, it is my brain
My blood and my flesh"
