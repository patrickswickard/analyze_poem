The Denial of Saint Peter

What does God do with the flood of curses
Which rises every day toward his dear Seraphim?
Like a tyrant gorged on meat and wine,
He listens to the soft noise of fearful blasphemies.

The weeping of the martyrs and the tortured
Doubtless are an intoxicating symphony,
Since, despite the blood their delights cost,
The heavens still are not at all sated!

Ah Jesus, remember Gethsemane!
You prayed on your knees in your simplicity
To Him in his heaven who laughed at the noise of the nails
Planted by ignoble torturers in your living flesh,

While you saw them spit upon your divine body,
The mob of guards and kitchen drudges,
And while you felt the thorns being pressed
Into your skull where great Humanity lived;

When the horrible weight of your broken body
Spread out your two outstretched arms, when your blood
And your sweat flowed from your blanching brow,
When you were posed before all like a target,

Did you then dream of days so brilliant and fair,
When you came to fulfill the eternal promise,
When you once trod, mounted on a soft ass,
On paths bestrewn with flowers and with palms,

When, heart full of hope and bravery,
You whipped all those vile merchants mightily,
Where you were then master? Did the remorse not
Penetrate your side before the lance?

Certainly as for me, I would leave, satisfied
From a world where action is not the sister of dream,
I'd rather live by the sword and die by the sword!
Saint Peter denied Jesus...as he should!
