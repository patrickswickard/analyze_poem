The Denial of Saint Peter

What does God do with the flood of curses
Which rises every day toward his dear Seraphim?
Like a tyrant gorged on meat and wine
He listens to the soft noise of fearful blasphemies

The weeping of the martyrs and the tortured
Doubtless are an intoxicating symphony
Since despite the blood their delights cost
The heavens still are not at all satieted

Ah Jesus, do you remember Gethsemane
You prayed on your knees in your simplicity
He who in his heaven laughed at the noise of the nails
Planted by ignoble torturers in his living flesh

While you saw spit on your divine body
The mob of guards and kitchen drudges
And while you felt the thorns being pressed
Into your skull where great Humanity lived,

Did you then dream of days so brilliant and so fair
When you came to fullfil the eternal promise
When you once trod, mounted on a soft ass 
Paths bestrewn with flowers and with palms

When, heart full of hope and bravery,
You whipped all those vile merchants mightily,
Where you were then master? Did the remorse not
Penetrate your side before the lance?

Certainly as for me, I would leave, satisfied
A world where action is not the sister of dream
I'd rather live by the sword and die by the sword
Saint Peter denied Jesus...as he should!
