Posthumous Remorse

While you will sleep, my beautiful dark one,
At the bottom of a monument built of black marble
And while you will have nothing for an alcove and mansion
But a leaky cellar and a hollow pit

When the stone, oppressing your fearful chest
And your sides which sigh with a charming nonchalance
Will prevent your heart from beating and from desiring
And your feet from walking their adventurous course

The tomb, confidant of my infinite dreaming
(Since the tomb will always understand the poet)
During the long nights when sleep is forbidden

Will say to you, "What good does it do you, imperfect courtesan
Not to have known why the dead do weep?"
And the worm will gnaw your flesh like a regret
