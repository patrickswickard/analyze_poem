Hymn

To the most dear, the most beautiful
Who fills my heart with light,
To the angel, the immortal idol,
Welcome to immortality!

She expands in my heart
Like the salt air,
And into my unsatisfied soul
Pours the taste of the eternal.

An ever fresh sachet which perfumes
The atmosphere of a dear nook,
A forgotten censer that secretly
Smolders through the night,

How, incorruptible love,
Do I truly express you?
Grain of musk that is buried, invisible,
At the bottom of my eternity!

To the most good, the most beautiful
Who is my delight and my health,
To the angel, to the immortal idol,
Welcome to immortality!
