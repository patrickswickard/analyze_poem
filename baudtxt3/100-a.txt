Benediction

Whenever, by decree of the powers supreme
The poet appears in this bored world
His mother, terrified and full of blasphemies,
Clenches her fists toward God, who takes pity on her

"Ah!  I'd rather have spawned a whole nest of vipers
Rather than nursing this ridiculous thing
Damn ,tys with he night of ephemeral pleasures
When my belly conceived this to atone for my sin

As soon as you chose me from all other women
To be the disgust of my sorrowful husband
And I couldn't just cast him into the flames
Like a love letter, this grotesque stunted monster

I will spew out your hatred which overwhelms me
On the damned instrument of your cruelty
And I'll twist so hard on this miserable tree
So that it can't push forth its pestilent buds"

And thusly she swallows the scum of her hate
And discounting the eternal plans
She herself prepares at the bottom of Hell
A pyre reserved for maternal crimes

However, under tutelage of an Angel unseen
The unwanted child is made drunk by the Sun
And in all the he drinks and in all that he eats
He finds sweet ambrosia and nectar of red

He plays with the wind and speaks with the clouds
And drunkenly swings the way of the cross
And the Spirit which leads him on this pilgrimage
Cries, seeing him gay like a bird in the woods

Those he wishes to love all regard him with fear
Or emboldened by his tranquility
Seek to draw from him a complaint
And use him to practice their ferocity

In the bread and the wine destined for his mouth
They mix in vile spittle and ash
These hypocrites throw away whatever he touches
And accuse themselves for treading in his steps

His wife goes crying in the public places,
"Since he finds me fair enough to love
I'll take on the role of the idols of old
And like them I want to be covered in gold

And I'll get drunk on spikenard, on incense, on myrrh
On genuflections, on meat and on wine
To know if I can in a heart that admires me
Laughingly usurp homages divine

And when I get bored of this impious farce
I will thrust forth my strong dainty hand
And my nails, like the claws of the Harpies
Will know how to tear a path into his heart

Like a frightened young bird who trembles and shakes
I'll tear out the bloody red heart from his chest
And in order to satiate my favorite beast
I'll throw it down to the ground with disdain"

Toward the sky where his eye sees a splendid throne
The Poet serene lifts his pious arms
And the vast brightness of his lucid spirit
Hides him away from the furious mob

"Blessed be, my God, who makes us suffr
Like a remedy divine for our impurities
And like the best and purest essence
Which prepares the strong for saintly pleasures

I know that you hold a place for the Poet
In the holiest ranks of the legions of saints
And whom you invite to the eternal feast
The feast of Thrones, Virtues, and Dominions

I know that sadness is a unique nobility
That earth and the inferno will never bite
And that weaving my mystical crown
Will need all the ages and all the universe

But the lost jewels of antique Palymra
The unknown metals, the pearls of the sea
Raised by your hands will not suffice
For that diadem shining and bright

Since it will not be made of pure light
Drawn from the sainted hearth of primeval rays
While the eyes of mortals in their full splendor,
Are nothing but dull and mournful mirrors!"
