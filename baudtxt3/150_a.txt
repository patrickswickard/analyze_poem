Conversations

You are a beautiful autumn sky, clear and pink!
But sadness surges in me like the sea
And as it swells, it leaves on my lip
The stinging souvenir of its bitter silt

Your hand glides in vain over my swooning breast
But what you are searching, my love, has been sacked
By the grip and fierce tooth of woman.
Seek not my heart any more; the beasts have devoured it.

My heart is a palace, withered by the crowd;
They drink there, they kill there, take each other by the hair
A perfume swims around your naked breast

O Beauty, strong scourge of the bitter, you desire it!
With your fiery eyes, lit like a feast,
Burn up the scraps that were left by the beasts!
