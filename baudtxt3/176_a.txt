The Pipe

I am the pipe of an author
One sees, contemplating my appearance
Abyssinian or Cafrine
That my master is a great smoker

When he is filled with sadness
I smoke like a chimney
Where a meal is cooked
For the return of the worker

I link and I rock his soul
In the moving blue web
That climbs from my burning mouth

And I give off a powerful balm
Which charms his heart and heals
His spirit from its fatigues
