The Owls

Under the black yews that shelter them
The owls perch in rows
Like strange gods
Darting their red eyes.  They meditate.

They will remain without stirring
Until the melacholy hour
When, pushing the slanting sun aside,
Darkness establishes itself

Their attitude teaches the wise
That one must fear in this world
The turmoil and the movement

The man made drunk by a passing shadow
Will always bear the punishment
Of having wanted to change his place
