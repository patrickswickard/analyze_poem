The Ideal

It will never be the beauty of vignettes
Damaged products, born in a worthless era,
Their feet in buskins, theif fingers in castanets,
Who will know how to satisfy a heart like mine

I leave to Gavarni, poet of the jaundiced,
His troop of gurgling beauties of the hospital,
Since I can't find among these sickly roses
A flower that resembles my red ideal

It must be a heart deep like an abyss
It is you, Lady Macbeth, powerful criminal soul,
Dream of Aeschylus hatched in a stormy climate

Or you, great Night, son of Michelangelo,
Who turns peacefully in a strange pose
Your temptations fashioned by the mouths of Titans
