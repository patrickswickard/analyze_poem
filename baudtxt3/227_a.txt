The Love of the Lie

When I see you pass by, my lazy love,
To the sound of a song muffled by the ceiling
You pause in your pace, harmonious and slow,
Sauntering by with your deep bored gaze;

When I glance at you under the gaslights, which paint
Your pale forehead, cast with a ghastly appeal,
Where the torches of evening light a false dawn,
Your eyes lure me in like those of a portrait;

I say to myself: How beautiful she is!  And eerily fresh!
The towering memory hangs heavy, like a royal crown,
And her heart, bruised like a peach,
Is ripe, like her body, for a knowing lover.

Are you the fruit of Autumn, a flavor for kings?
Are you a funeral urn waiting for tears?
Perfume which makes one dream of distant oases,
The caress of scented pillows, or baskets of flowers?

I know that those saddest of eyes,
Hide no precious secrets'
Beautiful cases without jewels, medallions without relics,
More empty and deep than Heaven itself!

But is it not enough that you'd have the appearance
For delighting a heart that flees the truth?
Does your senselessness or indifference matter?
Mask or mannequin, hello!  I adore your beauty!
