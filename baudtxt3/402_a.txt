On the Debut of Amina Boschetti at the Théâtre de la Monnaie in Brussels

Amina jumps, runs, then vaults and smiles;
The Belgian says "All that is Greek to me;
I don't know anything about the nymphs in the forest,
Only what is found on Rue Montagne-aux-Herbes-potagères."

From the sole of her fine foot to her smiling eye,
Amina spills out in streams delirium and spirit;
The Belgian says, "Go away, deceitful delight!
My spouse will have none of these light allures."

You known not, young sylph with triumphant legs,
That you wish to teach an elephant the waltz,
Teach an owl to be gay, teach a stork to laugh,

All your fiery grace makes the Belgian just sneer;
Bacchus himself could pour wine from Bourgogne,
And the monster would respond, "I'd prefer some sweet beer!"
