The Cask of Hate

Hate is a cask of pale Danaides
Desperate Vengeance, with arms red and strong
Pouring into his empty darkness
Great buckets full of blood and the tears of death

The Demon makes secret holes in these abysses
Through which flee thousands of years of sweat and toil
Even if she knew how to revive her victims
And for torturing them how to resuscitate their corpses

Hate is a drunkard at the bottom of a tavern
Who always feels a thirst born from the liquor
And which multiplies like the hydra of Lerne

But the happy drinkers know their conqueror
And Hate is doomed to a lamentable fate
Unable to ever sleep under the table
