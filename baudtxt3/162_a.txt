Mist and Rain

O end of Autumn, Winter, Spring soaked in mud
Sleep inducing seasons! I love you and praise you
So envelop my heart and my mind
With a vaporous shroud and a hazy tomb

In this great plain where the cold winds blow and play
Where through the long nights the weathervane creaks
My soul with more ease can spread its raven wings
Than it's able in weather more tepid and refreshing

Nothing is more sweet to a mournful heart
And as sure as the slow descent of the frost
Oh pale seasons, queen of our climates,

Than the permanent aspect of your faint shadows
Unless on a moonless night, side by side,
We lull sadness to sleep nestled in some strange bed.
