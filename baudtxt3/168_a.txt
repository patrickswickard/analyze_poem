The kind-hearted servant of whom you were jealous

The kind-hearted servant of whom you were jealous,
And who sleeps her slumber under the humble grass,
We should bring her some flowers.
The dead, the poor dead, have great sorrows,
And when October breathes, pruning the old trees,
Its melancholic wind around their marble graves,
Surely they should find the living ungrateful,
To sleep, as they do, warm in their sheets,
While, devoured by black dreams,
Without bed companions, without good conversation,
Old frozen skeletons beset by the worm,
They feel the draining of the snow in winter
And the years flowing, without friends or family
To replace the scraps that hang at their gates.
If some evening, while the log hisses and sings,
I should see her sit down calmly in the armchair
If, in some cold blue night in December
I should find her crouching in the corner of my room,
Coming gravely from the depths of her bed eternal
To gaze on the grown child with her eye maternal,
How could I respond to this pious soul,
Watching the tears fall from her hollow eyes?
