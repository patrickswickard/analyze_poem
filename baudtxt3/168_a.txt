The kind-hearted servant of whom you were jealous

The kind-hearted servant of whom you were jealous
And who sleeps his slumber under the humble grass
We should bring her some flowers
The dead, the poor dead, have great sorrows
And when October breathes, pruning the old trees
Its melancholic wind around their marble graves
Surely they should find the living ungrateful
To sleep, as they do, warm in their sheets
While, devoured by black dreams
Without bed companions, without good conversation,
Old frozen skeletons worked on by the worm,
They feel the draining of the snow in winter
And the years flowing, without friends or family
To replace the scraps that hang at their gates
If some evening, while the log hisses and sings,
I should see her sitting calmly in the armchair
If, in some blue cold night in December
I should find her crouching in the corner of my room
Coming gravely from the bottom of her bed eternal
To look at the grown child with her eye maternal
How could I respond to this pious soul
Watching the tears fall from her hollow eyes
