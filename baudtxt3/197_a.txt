The Death of Lovers

We will have beds full of light scents
Divans deep as the tombs
And strange flowers the shelves
Blooming for us under the most beautiful skies

Using over and over the last of their warmth
Our two hearts will be two vast flames
Which will reflect their double lights
On our two spirits, these twin mirrors

One evening with a pink and blue mystique
We will exchange a unique flash
Like a long sobbing, charged full of farewells

And later an angel, opening up the doors,
Will come to renanimate, faithful and joyous
The tarnished mirrors and the mortal flames
