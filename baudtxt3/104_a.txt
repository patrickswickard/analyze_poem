I love the memory of these nude epochs

I love the memory of these nude epochs
When Phoebus was pleased to gild the statues
So the man and the women in their agility
Rejoicing without lies and without anxiety
And the amorous sky caressing their backs
Exercised the health of their noble machine
So Cybele, fertile with generous goods
Found not her children with a burden too heavy
But, a she-wolf with a heart filled with communal tenderness
Let the universe drink from her brown nipples
The man, elegant, robust and strong, with the right
To be proud of who called him their king
Fruits pure of all insult and virginal, uncracked
With skin smooth and firm, calling out to be bitten

The poet today, when he wants to conceive
These native grandeurs, in the places where is seen
The nudity of man, and that of women
Feels a cold darkness envelope his soul
Before this black tableau full of terror
Oh monstrosities crying out for clothing!
Oh ridiculous things! Torsos deserving of masks!
Oh poor twisted bodies, scrawny, potbellied or flabby,
Which the god of utility, implacable and serene
Children, enameled, in their diapers of brass
And you women, alas, pale like candles
That erode and nourish debauchery, and you, virgins,
Followed by the heritage of maternal vice
And all the hideousness of fecundity

We have, it is true, corrupted nations
Of ancient peoples with unknown beauties
Their faces gnawed by chancres of the heart
And with what one may call the beauties of langour
But these inventions of our tardy muses
Never stop the diseased races
From paying an homage profound to the youth
To the saintly youth, with a simple air, a soft forehead
Eye limpid and clear like running water
Who goes scattering everywhere, carefree
Like the blue of the sky, the birds and the flowers
Her perfumes, her sounds, and her soft warmth
