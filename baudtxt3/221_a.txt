The Seven Old Men

for Victor Hugo

Swarming city, city full of dreams
Where ghosts in plain day accost passers-by
The mysteries flow through like the saps
In the narrow canals of a powerful colossus

One morning, however, in a sad street,
The mists exaggerated the height of the houses,
Which resembled the two banks of a drained river
A setting akin to the soul of an actor

A dirty and yellow fog flooded the space
I followed it, stiffening my nerves like a hero
And debating my soul, already weary,
The suburb shaken by heavy tip-carts

Suddenly an old man, whose yellow rags
Imitated the color of the rainy sky,
And whose aspect would make the alms rain down
If not for the wicked glint in his eye,

Appeared to me. One might say his eyes were soaked
With bile; his appearance sharpened the frost
And his great long beard, stiff like a sword
Projected forth like that of Judas

His spine wasn't just bent but seemed broken,
And formed with his legs a perfect right angle
The cane that he used completed the picture
It lent him the crookedness and maladroit steps

Of a sick quadruped or a three-legged Jew
In the snow and the mud he went forth mired down
As though crushing corpses beneath his slippers
More hostile than indifferent to the universe

His double followed him: beard, eye, back, cane, rags
No trait was different, coming from the same hell,
This hundred-year-old twin, and these baroque specters
Tread in the same steps toward some unknown goal

Of what repugnant plot was I then the object
What wicked trick was humiliating me?
I then counted seven times, minute by minute
This sinister old man who was multiplying!

This plot did mock my uneasiness,
And who is not gripped with a fraternal shiver?
Know well that despite such decrepitude
These seven hideous monsters had an eternal air

Could I have, without dying, contemplated an eighth
Inexorable likeness, ironic and fatal
Disgusting Phoenix, son and father the same?
But I turned my back to this hellish procession

Exasperated like a drunk who sees double
I returned and I closed my door, terrified
Sick and dejected, spirit feverish and troubled
Wounded by the mystery and absurdity

In vain my reason wanted to take the helm
The teasing storm at play derailed its efforts
And my soul was made to dance and dance, old barge
Without a mast, upon a monstrous infinite sea
