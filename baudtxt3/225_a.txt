The Skeleton Laborer

I

In the anatomical plates
Which lie on their dusty docks
Where many a cadaverous book
Sleeps like an antique mummy

Sketches of which the gravity
And the knowledge of an old artist
Although the subject can be sad
Has communicated the Beauty

One sees, that which is rendered complete
These horrible mysteries
Digging up like laborers
The figure studies and the skeletons

II

From this terrain that you dig up
Peasants resigned and funereal
With every effort of your spine
Or your denuded muscles

Say, what strange harvest
Convicts attached to mass graves
Attracts you, and what farmer
Has you filling his granary?

Do you want, (clear emblem of
Of a destiny too hard!)
To show even once one is in the grave
The sleep that was promised is unsure?

For us the Nothingness is betrayed
For everything, even Death, lies to us
And how everlasting
Alas! Must we be made be perhaps

In any unknown country
To skinn the sour earth
And push a heavy spade
Under our foot bloody and nude?
