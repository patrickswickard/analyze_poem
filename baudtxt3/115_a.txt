The Chastisement of Pride

In these marvelous times when Theology
Flowers with the most sap and energy,
It is said that a very great doctor,
After having won over indifferent hearts,
Stirred them within their blackest depths;
After having crossed toward the celestial glory
Some curious paths unknown to him himself,
Where pure spirits alone perhaps had come,
Like a man who climbed too high, struck by panic,
Cried out, taken by a satanic pride:
"Jesus, little Jesus! I have raised you up so high!
But if I wanted to attack your armor's flaws,
Your shame would be the equal of your glory,
And you'd be naught but a pathetic fetus!"

Immediately his reason left him.
The brilliance of this sun was covered with a veil
Chaos rolled over his intelligence, which had been
A living temple, full of order and opulence,
Once full of glory underneath its ceiling.
The silence and the night settled in him,
Like in a tomb for which the key was lost.
Since then he was like the beasts on the street,
And, when he went unseeing toward the fields,
Unable to distinguish summer and winter,
Dirty, useless and ugly like a thing used up,
He was a laughingstock, the joke of children.
