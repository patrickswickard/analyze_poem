The Enemy

My youth was nothing but a dark storm
Through which here and there shone brilliant sun
The thunder and rain had ravaged things so
That only a few ripe fruits remain in my garden

There I have touched the autumn of ideas
And the shovel and the rake need to be used
To gather anew the flooded terrain
Where the water dug holes the size of a tomb

And who knows if the new flowers I dream of
Will find in this soil, washed like the shore,
The mystical nourishment which will bring life to them

O sadness! Sadness! Time eats life
And the obscure Enemy eats at our heart
And strengthens and grows on the blood that we lose
