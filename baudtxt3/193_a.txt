The Wine of the Ragpickers

Sometimes in the red glow of a streetlight
Of which the wind beats the flame and torments the glass,
In the heart of an old suburb, a muddy maze
Where humanity swarms in tumultuous ferments,

One sees a ragpicker who comes, nodding his head,
Propped up, and banging on the walls like a poet,
And, without worrying about snitches, his subjects,
Spills out his heart in glorious projects.

He readies his oaths, dictates sublime laws,
Throws scoundrels to the ground, helps victims to their feet,
And under the firmament like a dais suspended
Gets drunk on the splendors of his own virtue.

Yes, these hassled people with household troubles
Ground down by work and tormented by age
Exhausted and bent under a pile of debris,
The mixed up vomit of enormous Paris,

Return, perfumed with the odor of wine casks,
Followed by companions, bleached in the battles,
Whose moustaches hang like old curtains.
The banners, the flowers and the triumphant arches

Are set up before them, what solmn magic!
And in the deafening and luminous orgy
Of trumpets, of sun, the cries of the drum
They carry the glory of people drunk from love!

It is thus that throughout vain Humanity
Wine carries gold, dazzling Fortune;
Through the throats of the men he sings his exploits
And rules through his gifts like the true kings.

To drown out rancor and cradle laziness
From all the old curses that die in silence,
God, touched by remorse, created sleep;
Man added Wine, sacred son of the Sun!
