Epigraph for a Condemned Book

Reader peaceful and bucolic,
Sober and naive good person,
Throw away this doleful book,
Orgiastic and melancholic.

If you did not study rhetoric
With Satan, that wily dean,,
Throw it away! You'll understand nothing,
Or else you'll think me hysterical.

But if, without being charmed,
Your eye plunges to the abyss,
Read me to learn to love me;

Curious soul who suffers,
And goes searching your paradise,
Pity me! Or else I curse you!
