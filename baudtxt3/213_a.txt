A Fantastic Engraving

This peculiar specter is only adorned
With a grotesque crown perched on its skeletal brow
Dreadful and smelling of Carnaval.
Without spurs, without whip, he exhausts his horse
A phantom like himself, apocalyptic mount,
Who foams at the nostrils like an epileptic
Together the two proceed through space
And trample the infinite with hazardous steps
The knight brandishes a flaming sabre
Over the nameless crowd trampled by his mount
And passing through like a prince inspecting his house
The cemetery vast and cold, without a horizon,
Where lie in the light of a dull white sun
The people of history, ancient and modern
