The Voice

My cradle leaned back against the library
A gloomy Babel where novels, science, fables,
Everything, the ashes of Rome, the dust of Greece
Mixed together. I was no taller than a folio.
Two voices spoke to me. One, insidious and firm,
Said, "The World is a cake full of sweetness;
I can give you an appetite of equal greatness
And your pleasure will be never-ending!"
And the other: "Come! Oh come voyage in dreams
Beyond the possible, beyond the known!"
And that one sang like the wind on the shores
Howling phantom, one known not whence it came,
Who caresses the ears and nonetheless frightens.
I responded to you, "Yes! Soft voice" It is therefore
That date that i could, alas, mark my wound
And my fatality. Behind the decor
Of immense existence, blacker than the abyss
I see distinctly the peculiar worlds
And, ecstatic victim of my clairvoyance
I lead the serpents who bite at my shoes
And since that time, like the prophets
I love so tenderly the desert and the sea
I laugh at sorrows and cry at festivals
As I find smooth flavors in the most bitter wine
And, eyes on the sky, I tumble into holes
But the voice consoles me and says "Watch your dreams
The wise ones aren't as beautiful as the mad!"
