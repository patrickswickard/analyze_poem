Sepulchre

If through a night heavy and dark
A good Christian, through charity
Behind some old debris
Buries your vaunted body

At the hour where the chaste stars
Close their heavy eyes
The spider spins her web
The viper gives birth to her young

You will hear all the year
Above your condemned head
The lamentable cries of wolves

And the scrawny sorcerers,
The frolics of old lechers
And the plots of evil scoundrels
